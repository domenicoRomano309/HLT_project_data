Kendrick Lamar,Hip-Hop,"Sing About Me, Iâ€™m Dying of Thirst","good kid, m.A.A.d city (Deluxe Version)",2012.0,"When the lights shut off and it's my turn. To settle down, my main concern. Promise that you will sing about me. I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn. I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you. In case I'm not here tomorrow. I'm hopin' that I can borrow. A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important. My mind is really distorted. I find nothing but trouble in my life. I'm fortunate you believe in a dream. This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine. And last night was just another distraction. Or a reaction of what we consider madness. I know exactly what happened. You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help. Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel. Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up. But the type of bullet that stuck. Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands. My plan's rather vindictive. Everybody's a victim in my eyes. When I ride it's a murderous rhythm. And outside became pitch black. A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!"". I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck. That same mentality I told my brother not to duck. In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors. I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover. The life that I knew as a youngin. In pajamas and dun-ta-duns. When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb. Niggas like me never prosper. Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted. This Piru shit been in me forever. So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever. And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did. Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big. And if I die before your album drop, I hope. You wrote a song about my sister on your tape. And called it Section.80. The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby"". What's crazy was I was hearin' about it. But doubted your ignorance. How could you ever just put her on blast and shit? Judgin' her past and shit? Well, it's completely my future. Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit. And I'ma need that forty dollars. Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow. In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed. By a married man, and father of three. My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys. Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's. He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week. This is the life of another girl damaged by the system. These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em. See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em. Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim. Of a family gene that show women how to be woman. Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'. Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught. Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed. And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit. My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain. If you can't fit the pumps I walk in? I'll wait Your rebuttal a little too late. And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song. 'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own. And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great? A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight. I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away. I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate. And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'. I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'. You lyin' to these motherfuckers. Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story. You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga. Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit. Sometimes I look in the mirror. And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away? If it's today, I hope I hear a. Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon. With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus. I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'. The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance. With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed. May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons. I suffer a lot. And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch. I tie my stomach in knots. And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death. My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats. That can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful. And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch. Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death. Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest. And you're right, your brother was a brother to me. And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me. In a direction to speak on somethin'. That's realer than the TV screen. By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between. Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told"". Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul. Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'. Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's. I count lives, all on these songs. Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong. Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong. And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone. Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in? Promise that you'll sing about me forever. Promise that you'll sing about me for ooooh. (On the phone). ""Ay, ay, ay, Where you 'bout to go?"". ""Nigga, the homie's brother-- nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!"". ""Nigga-- they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga."". ""Al- alright, nigga-- nigga just come-- alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back."". ""Arghh... Fuck!. So what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?"". ""Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like... nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga. We can go back right now"". ""Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!"". Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'. My own kind, but retirin' nothin'. Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'. Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't. Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst? Dope on the corner, look at the coroner. Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her. Stray bullets, AK bullets. Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't. Bring her back, who got the footage? Channel 9, cameras is lookin'. It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked. Banana clip, split his banana pudding. I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding. I know I'm good at. Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst. How many sins? I'm runnin' out. I lost count. Dreams of ballin' like Spalding. But only shotty bounce. The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth. Money is power (Money is power). Yours is ours (Yours is ours). Lay with a snitch, die with a coward. Hope we get rich, hope we can tower. Over the city with vanity with the music louder. The same song, a black flower. I'll show you how to. Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst. What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'? Hell is hot, fire is proven. To burn for eternity, return of the student. That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it. Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'. Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'. Now back to business, loadin' the guns in. Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'. The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion. Hereditary, all of my cousins. Too many sins, I'm runnin' out. Somebody send me a well for the drought. See all I know is takin' notes. On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke. My best days, I stress days. (Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know). Say ""fuck the world,"" my sex slave. Money, pussy, and greed what's my next crave? Whatever it is, know it's my next grave. Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'. Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' backwards. My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise. What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished? The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest. You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst. So hop in that water, and pray that it works."". Fuck! I'm tired of this shit!. I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit!. That's my brother, homie!. Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is? I know that's not what I think that is. Why are you so angry? See, you young men are dying of thirst. Do you know what that means? That means you need water, holy water. You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord. Do you want to receive God as your personal savior? Okay, repeat after me:. ""Lord God, I come to You a sinner."". (Lord God, I come to You a sinner). ""And I humbly repent for my sins."". (And I humbly repent for my sins). ""I believe that Jesus is Lord."". (I believe that Jesus is Lord). ""I believe you raised Him from the dead."". (I believe you raised Him from the dead). ""I would ask that Jesus come into my life."". (I would ask that Jesus come in my life). ""And be my Lord and Savior."". (And be my Lord and Savior). ""I receive Jesus to take control of my life."". (I receive Jesus to take control of my life). ""And that I may live for Him from this day forward."". (And that I may live for Him from this day forward). ""Thank you, Lord Jesus. For saving me with Your precious blood."". (Thank you, Lord Jesus. For saving me with Your precious blood). ""In Jesus name, amen."". (In Jesus name, amen). Alright now, remember this day. The start of a new life your REAL life.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

Struck a match to the underground, industry ignited. From metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth. Wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf. Scatting off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily. Tragically, that style deteriorate rapidly. Uncompleted missions, throwing your best known compositions. You couldn't add it up if you mastered addition. Where I come from, getting visuals is habitual. You're more safe walking on hot coals in rituals. I splash the paint on the wall, formed a mural. He took a look, saw the manifestation of it was plural. Rhyming while impaired, dart hit your garment. Pierced your internal streamlined compartments. Just consider the unparalleled advantage. Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage. Bitchass niggas counterfeit the funk. I smoke the bead of the skunk, tree top of the trunk. Moonshine drunken monk, your head get shrunk. Your treasure sunk, I be fucking bitches by the chunk. My name black, you worms wanna play in my dirt. Bitch stop, my Momma serve free lunch from the church. I cum like a thousand doves. Bitch you quiet at the bus, making no fuss, I got self love. Unglove the noose, watch a nigga transfuse. Dirty add to the fuse, heavy at the booze. I don't walk, I get carried.

My grandfather, step up and get knocked right the fuck out. Come to the cook-out, dirty bitch at the mouth. You scared, run around like the plane about to crash. Wu-Tang motherfuckers. Yeah and RZA. Yo, yo The Riddler, funny bone tickler, freak Caligula. Bigger dick sex enigma, pistil fertilize your stigma. Stinkbox order from Pink Dot. MCs get stuck on ink blots, AirSound plug to the sinkbox. Wu-Tang Incorp. take your brain on spacewarp. Talk strange like Bjork, great hero Jim Thorpe. How can I put it, life is like video footage. Hard to edit, directors, that never understood it. Too impulsive, my deadly corrosive dosage. Attack when you least notice through explosive postage. I don't play, the rap souffle saute for the day. Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig A Leg Leg Arm Head. Spread like plague, we drink Hennessy by the keg. I got the golden egg plus the goose. Eighty proof Absolut mixed with cranberry fruit juice. Ginseng root, I got your neck in a noose. Keep my money wrinkled, the rap star twinkle killer instinct. Sixteen bar nickel sell more copies than Kinko. Grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us. And we return like Jesus when the whole world need us. Is it appetite for destruction? Slap a murder rap on this production. I touch something, trust nothing. Iron Lung/Twisted Metal. I see 'em ducking my dart gun, busting from every angle. Worldwide total carnage, the sickest flow. That be codenamed Agent Orange, killing you slow. It's only right you pay homage.

You'd kill yourself for recognition. Kill yourself to never, ever stop. You broke another mirror. You're turning into something you are not. Don't leave me high. Don't leave me dry. Drying up in conversation. You will be the one who cannot talk. All your insides fall to pieces. You just sit there wishing you could still make love. They're the ones who'll hate you.

Garth Brooks,Country,That Summer,The Chase,1993.0,"I went to work for her that summer. A teenage kid so far from home. She was a lonely widow woman. Hell-bent to make it on her own. We were a thousand miles from nowhere. Wheat fields as far as I could see. Both needing somethin' from each other. Not knowin' yet what that might be. 'Til she came to me one evenin'. Hot cup of coffee and a smile. In a dress that I was certain. She hadn't worn in quite a while. There was a difference in her laughter. There was a softness in her eyes. And on the air there was a hunger. Even a boy could recognize. She had a need to feel the thunder. To chase the lightnin' from the sky. To watch a storm with all its wonder. Ragin' in her lover's eyes. She had to ride the heat of passion. Like a comet burnin' bright. Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been. Burnin' both ends of the night. That summer wind was all around me. Nothin' between us but the night. And when I told her that I'd never. She softly whispered that's alright. And then I watched her hands of leather. Turn to velvet in a touch. There's never been another summer. When I have ever learned so much. We had a need to feel the thunder. Ragin' in each others eyes. We had to ride the heat of passion. I often think about that summer. The sweat, the moonlight and the lace. And I have rarely held another. When I haven't seen her face. And every time I pass a wheat field. And watch it dancin' with the wind. Although I know it isn't real, I just can't help but feel. Her hungry arms again.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

So we go inside and we gravely read the stones. All those people, all those lives. Where are they now? With loves and hates. And passions just like mine. They were born. And then they lived. And then they died. Seems so unfair. I want to cry. You say: ""'Ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn"". And you claim these words as your own. But I've read well and I've heard them said.

Tied up to a heart of stone. I screamed into a microphone. I burned the bridge, so I won't find my way home. Lay with me, I can't sleep. When I'm bent, when I'm cracked. When I'm broken.

Eminem,Hip-Hop,The Ringer,Kamikaze,2018.0,"*Plane crash*. Yeah (Illa, Illa, Illa). Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, 'cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now. Yeah. Let me explain just how to make greatness. Straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break it down. Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout. To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows. If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!). Full magazine could take Staples out. Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account. But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown. Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch. I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'. My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y'all are. To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view. You mention me, millions of views, attention in news. I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you. Billions of views, your ten cents are two. Skim through the music to give shit reviews. To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse. Don't get misconstrued, business as us'. Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do. Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get. What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to. Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow. Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no. Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adios. I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though. Not even dissin', it just ain't for me. All I am simply is just an emcee. Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?). Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean. Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably. Shake the world up if it were up to me. Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill. I should eat a pill, probably I will. Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death. I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath. Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed. Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (""Evil"" spelled). Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick. With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip. Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench. While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch. Like Vice President Mike Pence. Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip. These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic. Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and. Jesus Christ, man, how many times is. Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!). You won't ever see Em icy. But as cold as I get on the M-I-C. I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze. And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it. Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah). Turn down for what? I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa). 'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut. Now when it doesn't matter what caliber. I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks. You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck. Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks? And now he wants to take it out on us"" (Ooouuu). But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy. Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study. It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu). I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that. I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry. Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing). So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'. Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne. I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name. I'm fed up with bein' humble. And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings. I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach. I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo. The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to. What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it? I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two. And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner. If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner. I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it. I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper. You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's. But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival. But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider. Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned. And you woulda bought it. But sayin' I no longer got it. 'Cause you missed a line and never caught it. 'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it. 'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest. With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist. And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless. What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa). Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it. Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic. With a bottle full of malt liquor. But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer. The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom. If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet. I don't see why y'all even started with me. I get in beefs, my enemies die. I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased. I'm east side, never be caught slippin'. Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink. I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats. I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze. ""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage. The Thing ain't even orangeoh my God, that's a reach!"". Shout to all my colorblind people. Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green. Aquamarine, or you think water is pink. ""Dawg, that's a date."" ""Looks like an olive to me."". ""Look, there's an apple!"" ""No, it's not, it's a peach!"". So finger-bang, Pootie Tang. Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang. Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say. Give me Donkey of the Day. What a way for 2018 to get underway. But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say. Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah). Invite 'em in like a One A Day. I'm not done (Preach!). 'Cause I feel like the beast of burden. That line in the sand, was it even worth it? 'Cause the way I see people turning's. Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose. I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds. And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word. Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict. Or still yet to be determined? 'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped. But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it. And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent. Sold the dream to that he's deserted. But I think it's workin'. These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous. And he's too scurred to answer me with words. 'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered. But I know at least he's heard it. 'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service. To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him. Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists. I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists."". But my beef is more media journalists. (Hold up, hold up, hold up). I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist. Can get a mouthful of flesh. And yes, I mean eating a penis. 'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death. So I've been givin' the media fingers. Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh. But they've been puttin' me through the ringer. So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press. But I just took this beat to the cleaners.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1

Some guys have all the luck. Some guys have all the pain. Some guys have a little sunshine in their lives. My life is always filled with rain. Someone to take. On a walk down by the lake. Dear Lord let her be. Someone who shouts. Someone who is liable to cry. At sad movies. I do believe I will die. Just to look in your eyes. And find them filled with me. But you're just a dream.

N.W.A,Hip-Hop,Express Yourself,Straight Outta Compton,1988.0,"Dr. Dre: Yo, man, it's a lot of brothers out there flakin' and perpetratin' but scared to kick reality. Ice Cube: Man, you've been doin' all this dope producing, but you ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is. Dr. Dre: So what you want me to do? ... (Express yourself). I'm expressing with my full capabilities. And now I'm living in correctional facilities. Cause some don't agree with how I do this. I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist. I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary. But my technique is very necessary. Blame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky. When you got a subject and a predicate. Add it on a dope beat and that'll make you think. Some suckers just tickle me pink. To my stomach, cause they don't flow like this one. You know what? I won't hesitate to dis one. Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this. Some drop science, well I'm dropping English. Even if Yella makes it a cappella. I still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess. Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage. And brain damage on the mic don't manage nothing. But making a sucker and you equal, don't be another sequel. Express yourself. Come on and do it. Now, getting back to the PG. That's program, and it's easy. Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow. Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow. The words, the style, the trend, the records I spin. Again and again and again, yo, you on the other end. Watch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help. There's no fessing and guessing while I'm expressing myself. It's crazy to see people be. What society wants them to be, but not me. Ruthless is the way to go, they know. Others say rhymes that fail to be original. Or they kill where the hip-hop starts. Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts. Some musicians cuss at home. But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone. Yeah, they want reality but you won't hear none. They rather exaggerate a little fiction. Some say no to drugs and take a stand. But after the show they go looking for the dopeman. Or they ban my group from the radio, hear N.W.A and say ""Hell no!"". But you know it ain't all about wealth as long as you make a note to. From the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart. Then expression is a big part of it. You ain't efficient when you flow. You ain't swift, moving like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis. There's a little bit more to show. I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo. Or a lesson, all of 'em expression. And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wesson for you. I might ignore your record because it has no bottom. I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn. It's Dre on the mic, getting physical. Doing the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob. Yes, I'm macabre but you know you need this. And the knowledge is growing, just like a fetus. Or a tumor but here's the rumor. Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good. When I start expressing myself, Yella slam it. Cause If I stay funky like this, I'm doing damage. Or I'mma be too hyped and need a straight jacket. I got knowledge and other suckers lack it. So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic. Ask what it's like, it's like we getting hype tonight. Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health. But I won't strike if you just.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1

Tell my kids that I love em but don't tell em that I'm doing. Keep tryin' and tell em I'll be home soon. Oh baby I'm goin crazy. Cos I keep seein shit that amaze me. Still I had to kill a motherfucker last week. He thought I was a punk and tried to creep up on me in my sleep. I just think that I could hold or squeeze or touch or buck ya. But I can't, so fuck it. I'mma behind these bars and it's burnin like nitro. I might go psycho, the man on the tower got a rifle. Aw shit, there the lights go.. *phone ringing*. (Hello). Chorus: LeShaun. Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta (damn). Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta (y'know). Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta and I know he's a killer. But I love dat nigga. Bridge: LeShaun. Hey ba-by. What's happenin honey? How you doin? I miss you. Verse 2: LeShaun. The kids keep askin where's their papa? I had to tell em daddy got caught by the coppers. It's time for me to raise em up proper by myself. It's a goddamn struggle when a bitch ain't got no help. Now everybody tellin me that you ain't shit black. And when you get out, you'll jack and probably go right the fuck back. Damn, the pressure's gettin hot and heavy. And yeah, I'm gettin sweated by your homey in the blue and white Chevy. But now he's got a condo and a brand new Lexus. Wants me to take a trip with him down to Texas. The ends don't justify the means. And in another life he might've been the man of my dreams. But you know I got your back to the motherfuckin end. But a bitch can't even trip like she doen't need a friend. Chorus. Interlude:. (Hello, you have a collect call from...). Coolio!.

Don't you make me break up outta this motherfucker. And start killin motherfuckers, SHIT!. I know it's rough, I know it's tough. But when you fumble in the game sometimes you get locked up. You better stay away from that punk ass bitch, he ain't shit. And I don't wanna have to kill him. Cos think about the times that we used to have. Don't make me reach out and touch that ass. You put yourself in danger when you fuck with a buster. Like shootin dice without a pistol in a circle of murderers. You got more class than the average-type hooker bitch. Don't switch, he gotta grip but he ain't rich. Now I gotta jet, but if you've got the cheque. Give a nigga a look and put somethin on my books. Peace. Verse 4: LeShaun. Aiyo remember the homey with the Lexus, he took the trip to Texas. Now he's wearin the fuckin Lexus like a necklace. So tell me, what's the drill, baby pa? What's a bitch to do? My nigga's stretched in the pen since '92. Them visits ain't doin the trick, drop fucks make me sick. Cos this po' puddy-tat needs a cat nip. And that motherfucker representin you, I think he resents you. He got evidence he never presents to. The people in court, I heard witnesses abortin.

Look, you might take it as a trip. But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip. Straight outta Compton. (Straight outta Compton). Eazy is his name, and the boy is coming.

Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive. That's why I'd rather take the 405. I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim. But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him. Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents. What I'm supposed to do? Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints? Every agent I know, know I hate agents. I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant. Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance. It's just me, I do it my way, bitch. Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans.

Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along. Because every time I hear that song. I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy. Driving my first love out to the levee. Living life with no sense of time. And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line. A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine. Wishing time would stop right in its tracks. Every time I hear that song, I go back. I go back. I used to rock all night long to ""Keep On Rocking Me Baby"". Frat parties, college bars, just trying to impress the ladies. And I go back to the smell of an old gym floor. And the taste of salt on a Carolina shore. After graduation and drinking goodbye to friends. And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall. Growin up too fast and I do recall. Wishin time would stop right in its tracks. Everytime I hear that song, I go back. We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives. Takes us to another place and time. So I go back to a pew, preacher, and a choir. Singing bout God, brimstone, and fire. And the smell of Sunday chicken after church. And I go back to the loss of a real good friend. And the sixteen summers I shared with him. Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks. Every time I hear that song. To the feel of a fifty yard line. I go back (I go back). To watching summer fade to fall. Growing up too fast and I do recall. To the loss of a real good friend.

Dulled my senses blurred my sight. I chose the road of passion and pain (passion and pain). Sacrificed too much and waited in vain. Gave up my power ceased being queen. Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend. See, torn and confused wasted and used. Reached the crossroad which path would I choose. Stuck and frustrated I waited, debated. For something to happen that just wasn't fated. Thought what I wanted was something I needed. When momma said no I just should have heeded. Misled I bled 'till the poison was gone. And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn. Father you saved me and you showed me that life. Was much more than being some foolish man's wife. Showed me that love was respect and devotion. Greater than planets and deeper than any oceans. See, my soul was weary but now it's replenished. Content because that part of my life is finished. I see him sometimes and the look in his eye.

Dr.Â Dre,Hip-Hop,Medicine Man,Compton,2015.0,"Doc, doc, you gotta give us some good news. (Yeah, about that). Don't let me find out the bitch in you. Don't let me find out the snitch in you. Fame and fortune is not your forte. Fuck the world now, I'm done with foreplay. Doctor's orders: go fuck yourself. Take two of these in the mornin', overdose and kill yourself. Doctor's orders. Listen, this is my evaluation. This shit oversaturated, y'all can get evacuated. Kids sippin' Actavis and they ain't even activated. Married to the Internet, stuck in place, salivatin'. Ain't nobody graduatin'. Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it. That's why I gotta hate it. Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration. Damn, I'm gettin' aggravated. Fuck, I'm gettin' agitated. Teachers so underpaid in these fuckin' schools. The police got our name in all they databases. Girls be thirteen actin' twenty-two. Niggas be forty-four actin' half they ages. Somebody tell me, what the fuck is goin' on? These niggas in tight shit, I'm in the fuckin' Matrix. It's lookin' like a sign of the revelation. 'Bout time of the return of the fuckin' greatest. I got all these patients, man. How come they ain't patient with me? They just think I want the money. Why? When I can't take it with me. Y'all don't do it for the love, for the love not. They gon' find out who you are. Just admit it 'fore you get admitted. Say, what you livin' about? (Fuck you gon' tell me?). Do you remember where you started out though? You're lookin' lost now (You want a pass? Oh, damn!). Fake it 'til you make it, take your little paper. But when you look in the mirror your credibility's gone now. I'd rather be hated on for who I am. Than to be loved for who I'm not, that's word to Doc. In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem I was this good scoffed, I just shook off. Prob'ly reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf. Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant. But based on how I ascended. See how plain it was now, they want me to jet. But no one really gave a fuck about my descent, 'til I took off. Mistook me because I looked soft. But I stood tall, I just followed the (Doctor's orders). So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off. Decided opposing you is what I'm 'posed to do, all's. I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls. And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all. You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls. And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone. My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls. And fuckin' goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls. Karma's headed for Armageddon. The drama setter, I'm going in, already got an arm and head in. Whoever said words are just words ain't heard me word 'em. I give a fuck if my image even ends up taking a personal hit. Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned in this bitch. And whatever bitches feel like they didn't deserve what they get. And whatever consequences come with every verse. It's worth it, so Doc turn the beat on. Whose turn is it to get murdered on it? And here's to all the years I spent toein' a line to overtime. As sure as a mole is blind. In my mind I'm still underground as a groundhog. And I'ma go for mine, like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find. No signs of slowin', these lines are my 9's. I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind. All I needed was someone to co-sign. Been a (Doctor's) assault rifle. With the sniper scope for this whole time. Day one, say when to blast, just give me the order, I spray (uh). Pain in the ass, you'll get shot in the ass with a paint gun. Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none. I even make the bitches I rape cum. I'm waitin' on someone to say somethin'. Dre, make the bass pump!. And let the tape run for old time's sake!. I spit it straight through, this is take one.

John Denver,Country,The Mountain Song,Autograph,,I came here from the city. A thousand miles away. I came just for a little while. You know I never meant to stay. I meant to take my pleasure. Have a good time and be gone. But I fell in love with a lady. Now I sing a mountain song. I listened to the music. Of the night wind in the pines. I saw the quiet slendour. Of a field of columbine. I skied on crystal pathways. To a mountain peak so tall. And I walked the mighty summits. With the one who made it all. And I fell in love with a lady. 'Cause I've seen her at her best. And I've walked her wild and rugged paths. Through her open wilderness. And now I never can betray her. Steal her riches and be gone. 'Cause when you love a mountain lady. You're gonna sing a mountain song. Now people come from everywhere. To see what they can find. And some take lots of pictures. And some just take their time. But they're some who take her beauty. That can't be bought or sold. And they think of only money. While destroying wealth untold. But you fall in love with a lady. When you've slept upon her breast. To her open wilderness. And you never can betray her.,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Merle Haggard,Country,He Walks With Me (In The Garden),Songs For The  Mama That Tried,1981.0,I come to the garden alone. While the dew is still on the roses. And the voice I hear falling on my ear. The son of God discloses. And he walks with me and he talks with me. And he tells me I am his own. And the joy we share as we tarry there. None other has ever known. He speaks and the sound of his voice is so sweet. The birds hush their singing. And the melody that he gave to me. Within my heart is ringing. I'd stay in the garden with him. Though the night around me is falling. But He bids me go through the voice of woe. His voice to me is calling.,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
Bauhaus,Rock,A God in an Alcove,In the Flat Field,,"Go and look for the dejected once proud. Idol remembered in stone aloud. Then on coins his face was mirrored. Take a look it soon hath slithered. To a fractured marble slab, renunciation clad. His nourishment extract from his subjects. That mass production profile. He's a God in an alcove. Once he spread the rain. So they dreamt in vain. Once he spread the wheat. Had made garlands for his feet. Until the lily poet of our times. Horizoned on the line. Love became the in theme then. Opposing fakers thrice by ten. Don't perceive his empty plea. That redundant effigy. Take in view his empty stool. What's left is satin cool. Clawing adornment for his crimes. They saw they had to draw the line. So they sent him far away. To a little alcove. All alone. He's a God, a God. Now I am silly. Silly, silly, silly, silly. Silly.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

Cause daddy's name wadn't Willy Woodrow. And I wadn't born and raised in no ghetto. Just a white boy lookin' for a place to do my thing. Well I'm out to find me a wealthy woman. And a line of work that don't take no diploma. I ain't got much to lose but a lot to gain. Well some might call me a goodtime fella. I ain't black and I ain't yella.

If you wanna get ahead you gotta hump and get it. I'm a white boy lookin' for a place to do my thing. Hump and git it now. Yeah I'm a small town boy been around a little. I like guitars and I like a fiddle. And that's the kinda soul it takes to fan my flame. Well I'm a blue eyed Billy kinda frail and ruddy. So I'll have to work to be somebody.

J. Cole,Hip-Hop,Fire Squad,2014 Forest Hills Drive,2014.0,"Nigga why you actin' like a ho? Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go. Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time? When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb? Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch? If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich? Come here baby why you always insecure? Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure. Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest. A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest. I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants. I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas. 'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine. My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun. In fact I just might need two, cause niggas say they the one. And I got something to prove. Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW. My inhibition's fighting my intuition. Premature premonition, showing me the demolition. Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time. Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing. You want the truth well come and listen. I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing. As fate passes you by, half of you try. The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly. One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be. A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me. Keep it true like me, Cole you might be. Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T. Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee. Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee. Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee. Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me!. BLAOOOW!. (Who's the king?). Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt. What you expected from me, I came from the dirt. Money my motivator, the songs that I sing. Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king. You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go. Will I return or will I burn, never know. Look in my eyes and see the future. But don't sugar coat it. Listen. History repeats itself and that's just how it goes. Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows. Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll. Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore. While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown. Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound. This year I'll prolly go to the awards dappered down. Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile. I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit. Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with. But not Jermaine, my aim too sick. I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick. You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid. I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid. And break the chains and change minds. One verse at a time, and claim 2-6. And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king? We all kings. (We all kings nigga). Kings of ourselves first and foremost. (True). While the people debate who's the king of this rap game. Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine. With every ounce of strength in his veins. To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it. But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it. Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic. With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates. And falls to the Earth from which it came. It's done. Ain't gonna be no more kings. Be wary of any man that claims. Because deep down he clings onto the need for power. The reality, he's a coward. Ultimately he's scared to die. And sometimes so am I. But when I'm in tune with the most high. I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side. Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I. Different kind of skin, different set of eyes. Two different minds, but only one God. (It's only one God nigga). It's for all the kings. 'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved.",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1
Busta Rhymes,Hip-Hop,We Made It,,2008.0,"Together we made it. We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall. See, a nigga survived the worst, but my life is glorious. Better know that I leaped every hurdle and I'm so victorious. Take a look, I'm a symbol of greatness. Now call a nigga Morpheus. As force securin' the win, better believe I'm so notorious. You know that I've been 'bout my bread. Even though we rappin' now. And yes, we used to live on the strip. Even though a nigga higher level trappin' now.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yo. When it all got started we were steadily just gettin' rejected. It seemed like nothin' we could do would ever get us respected. At best we were stressed. At the worst they probably said we're pathetic. Had all the pieces to that puzzle, just the way to connect it. I was fightin' through every rhyme, tightenin' up every line. Never restin' the question if I was out of my mind. It finally came time to do it or let it die. So we put the chips on the table and told 'em to let it ride. Sing it, yeah!. Look, in case you misunderstand exactly what I'm buildin'. Shit that I can leave for my children's children's children's children. Now on my wake-up I smile to see how far I've come. Fightin' for sales on a strip to I gained the hustle from. From nights in jail on a bench usin' my muscles, son. To countin' money like Dre and Jimmy and Russell was.

With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain at hand. You run for cover in the temple of love. You run for another but still the same. For the wind will blow my name across this land. In the temple of love you hide together. Believing pain and fear outside. But someone near you rides the weather. And the tears he cried will rain on walls. As wide as lovers eyes. In the temple of love, shine like thunder. In the temple of love, cry like rain. In the temple of love, hear my calling. In the temple of love, hear my name. And the devil in black dress watches over. My guardian angel walks away. Life is short and love is always over in the morning. Black wind come carry me far away. With the sunlight died and night above me. With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain inside. You run for another it's all the same. For the wind will blow and throw your walls aside. With the fire from the fireworks up above. With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain. Shine like thunder, cry like rain. And the temple of love grows old and strong. But the wind blows stronger, cold and long. And the temple of love will fall before us. Black wind calls my name to you no more. Ooooooooh. In the black sky thunder sweeping underground. And over water sounds of crying weeping. Will not save your faith for bricks and dreams for mortar. All your prayers must seem as nothing, ninety-six below the wave. When stone is dust and only air remains. In the temple of love (temple of love), shine like thunder. In the temple of love (temple of love), cry like rain (cry like rain). In the temple of love (temple of love), hear the calling. And the temple of love. Is falling down. Temple of love. All your prayers must seem as nothing. Ninety-six below the wave. When stone is dust and air remains. The only haven you can trust. And the temple grows old and strong. But the wind blows stronger cold and long. And the temple of love will fall before.

I write lines down, then rip them up. Describing love can't be this tough. I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if. I could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly. Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon. Play it for the world, but it won't mean much. Unless I sing this song to you. I'm dying to show you. This could end happily ever after. There doesn't ever have to be disaster. And all you have to do is sing along. Impossible describing love. I could set this song on fire. Sing this song to you.

And Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose. Throughout my struggles in the hood, I started learning. Life's a bitch with a pretty face, but she burning. Man I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar. Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tah-Tah. Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facing. Go against crews like Bebo and killers like Pappy Mason. A lot of niggas I know been corrupted since birth. Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth. I know some cats that held down whole complexes like Corley Wall. Together niggas stand and divided they fall. Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion. Come around here with your Rollie, you can get robbed like Ocean. Lord knows, Tommy had Laurelton sold. Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior. Might sound like I'm fantasizing, but son I'm dead serious. Montana was no dummy, brought business to wash the money. Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian. Feds couldn't catch him dirty, so settled for tax evasion. Rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about, yo. The twins was from Queens but got crazy cream with Alpo. Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy. Jamaican Pauly, Duckie Corley. Ronnie Bumps and Chick... shit. A lot a niggas flow the way I flow. But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know. Writing rhymes is the best way I express how I feel. If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail. Coming up I heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused. And if you watch the news you see players in this game that lose. I'm forgetting Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance. Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags. In a conversation over shrimp and lobster. At Benihana's, heard Chico stopped boxing, and started robbing diners. Shout out to Clarence and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will. If the flow don't kill you the MAC will.",0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1
Merle Haggard,Country,Rainbow Stew,20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection: The Best of Merle Haggard,1981.0,There's a big brown cloud in the city. And the countryside's a sin. And the price of life is to high to give up. Got to come down again. When the world wide war is over and done. And the dream of peace comes true. We'll all be drinking that free bubble up. And eating that rainbow stew. When they find out how to burn water. And the gasoline car is gone. When an airplane flies without any fuel. And sunlight heats our home. One of these days when the air clears up. And the sun come shining through. Eating rainbow stew with a silver spoon. Underneath that sky of blue. You don't have to get high to be happy. Just think about what's in store. When people start doing what they oughta to be doing. They won't be booing no more. When a president goes through the white house doors. And does what he says he'll do.,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

Is it the size of your tires and your fires, or your wild ass buddies? Well, give me a minute, let me hit you with some hometown truth. You could be a cowboy on the Texas plain. Or a plowboy waitin' on the rain. We're all a little different, but we're all the same. Everybody doin' their own thing. I got my dirt road cred when I was twelve. On a no cab tractor hauling them bales. Backing in boats, fishing limb lines. Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines. Step side cover down in peanut dust. Friday night spotlight, and that was us. It might not have been you, but I can't judge. Just be proud of what makes you country. Does it run in your blood? Did it come from your daddy and mama? Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio? That feels so right. Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson? Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know. Me, I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church. Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt. Waiting for the fall to finally come along. So I can grab my gun and get my outside on. Might be from a city or a little farm town. Whatever kind of square that you drove around. Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down? You know you gotta let it out. I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve. Running bird dogs through them Georgia pines. It might not have been you, but I ain't judging. And just be proud of what makes you country. Whatever makes you country. You do your kind of country. They doing they kind of country. I do my kind of country. Whatever makes us country.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1

I slid up in here with the brothers from the Marley family, crestin, we 'gon set for y'all. Hey! She loves to party, have a good time. She looks so hearty, feeling fine. She loves to smoke, sometimes shifting coke. She's laughing when there ain't no joke, hey!!!. (Background Singers). (Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was now. (Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was. (Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was, now. Cause coke was a thing that once she first tried. Was once a blue moon to once a blue sky. And now she's wonderin who else wants to go buy. She don't got no money and wants to get high. Story sounds familiar like born to be wild. But she sillier, not quite the same but she similiar. A waste of a sarsaparilla. Used to look good in the videos now she look hideous. Now it's broken crack pipes with lipstick traces. Work the cold nights red district places. She seen more hotels then my tour suitcases. More male customers than Old Navy. She love limelight more than John Swayze. Seen more miles than a rental, Avis. She don't slow down then some day maybe. She lost then she can't find her way to safety. (Pimpa'ss paradise) That's all she was now. Check it out! She keep her head up in space like a satellite. Because she got a insatiable appetite. For stayin out late night with all the parasites. Plottin on the way to cop a little piece of paradise. Her dignity the only thing that she could sacrifice. Just get the monkey off her back and she be back in like. Five minutes, she stay on the move. She done smoked up the stone that the builder refused. All coked up, alone she ain't even in tuned. And it's sad cause she ain't really have a reason to use. She was a pretty girl cleaner than the board of health, studied and enjoyed herself. I don't know what drove her to avoid herself. Destroyed herself and took a taste of the yay. And now she on the track workin while she wastin away. It's safe to say she lookin for some place to stay. Whoever got a lil' paper to play could get a slice of this... (Background Singers). For no reason a seasoned spliff was the first thing. One spring season while she's out flirtin. Now she season me and don't need rehearsin. Esteem get a beatin', life is uncertain. Ego need feedin now no one's mercy. Beneath the demons she's a warm person. When she's not fiendin swearin and cursin. Behind the curtain she's really hurtin. And while her people don't even trust her at home. The dealer that bring and cook the rock down. And she without sinnin will spot the first stone. The feelin kicks in she's in the dark zone. Old friends walk pass goin bout there own. As if she is someone that they don't know. Then the King Of Kings lift her off the flo'. Sayin life is a thing when you learn you grow. She rise and fall like a star, her life write off like a car. Her face full of all kind of scar, always quick fi start a war. She can't keep herself up to par, she plays like a broken guitar. She always want take it to far. I doubt she ah go make it too far. She rise and fall like a star, her ride off like a car. Her face full of all kind of scar, always with fist start a war. Mi wonder if she make it so far, wuy!!! !.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

To bring me back to life. I told the world, one day I would pay it back. Say it on tape, and lay it, record it, so that one day I could play it back. But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that. Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so gray and black. Hope, I just need a ray of that.

The teacher always got mad so we passed notes. It started off so innocent. She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it. I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool. But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school. 'Cause when I seen them thighs on her. And them hips on her and them lips on her. Got me daydreamin', man, what. I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it. Make it hard for me to stand up. As time goes by, attractions gettin' deep and. Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'. I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before. She wrote a note that said, ""You ever had sex before?"". Damn. And I ain't never did this before, no. And I ain't never did this before, nooo. I ain't never did this before, no. I wrote back and said. ""Of course I had sex before,"" knowin' I was frontin'. I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowin' I was stuntin'. But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son. Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one. But she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me. ""Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me. My mama gone for the weekend. So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'."". That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'. Baby, you done woke my lil' man up. I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed. Teacher, please, don't make me stand up. I wrote back like, ""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan."". Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man. But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'. Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin. Fuck. You know that feelin' when you know. You finna bone for the first time? I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time. I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck with. And most of all I'm prayin', ""God, don't let me bust quick!"". I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right. Practice puttin' condoms onhow it go, right? I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'. With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection. That's when my hands start touchin'. And her face start blushin' and a nigga roll over on top. And then she get my pants unbuckled. And her hands start rubbin' on me, ooh girl, don't stop. It's time for action. Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced. But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it. And said, ""I wanna get somethin' off my mental. I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, 'cause"". 'Cause I ain't never did this before, no.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0

Alan Jackson,Country,Midnight In Montgomery,Donâ€™t Rock The Jukebox,1992.0,"Midnight in Montgomery, Silver Eagle, lonely road. I was on my way to Mobile, for a big New Year's Eve show. I stopped for just a minute, to see a friend outside of town. Put my collar up, I found his name, and felt the wind die down. And a drunk man in a cowboy hat took me by surprise. Wearing shiny boots, a Nudie suit, and haunting haunted eyes. He said friend it's good to see you, it's nice to know you care. Then the wind picked up and he was gone, was he ever really there? 'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery. Just hear that whip-poor-will. See the stars light up the purple sky. Feel that lonesome chill. 'Cause when the wind is right you'll hear his songs. Smell whiskey in the air. Midnight in Montgomery. He's always singing there. Well I climbed back on that Eagle, took one last look around. Through red tail lights, a shadow moved, slow across the ground. And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by. I can hear that whistle moan, I'm so lonesome I could cry. Yeah, he's always singing there. Oh, Hank's always singing there.",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0
