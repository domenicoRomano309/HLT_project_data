Be pure - be vigilant - behave. Grey not neon, grey not real. Life bleeds, death is your birthright. P.C. she speaks impotent, sterile, naive, blind, atheist, sadist. Stiff-upper lip, first principle of her silence, of her silence. P.C.P. - a P.C. police victory. Pyrrhic victory. When I was young P.C. meant Police Constable.

Doctors arrested for euthanasia. Kill smokers through blind vanity. If you're fat don't get ill. Europe's gravestone carved in plastic. she says inoculate, hallucinate, beware Shakespeare. Bring fresh air, king cigarette snuffed out. By her midgets, by her midgets. caresses bigots and big brother, read Leviticus.

Superunknown,Superunknown. If this isn't what you see. It doesn't make you blind. If this doesn't make you feel. It doesn't mean you've died. Where the river's high. If you don't want to be seen.

If this doesn't make you free. It doesn't mean you're tied. If this doesn't take you down. It doesn't mean you're high. If this doesn't make you smile. You don't have to cry.

Ain’t No Fun (If the Homies Can’t Have None),"Ain’t No Fun (If the Homies Can’t Have None). You're back now at the jack-off hour. This is DJ EZ Dicc. On W-Balls. Right now something new by Snoop Doggy Dogg. And this one goes out to the ladies from all the guys. A big bow wow wow. Cause we gonna make it a little misty here tonight. On the station that slaps you across your fat ass. With a fat dick. When I met you last night, baby. Before you opened up your gap. I had respect for you lady. But now I take it all back. Cause you gave me all your pussy. And you even licked my balls. Leave your number on the cabinet. And I promise baby, I'll give you a call. Next time I'm feeling kinda horny. You can come on over. And I'll break you off. And if you can't fuck that day baby. Just lay back and open your mouth. Cause I have never met a girl. That I love in the whole wide world. Well if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke. I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke. I gets loc'ed and loony. Bitch you can't do me. Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie. I have no love for hoes. That's something that I learned in tha Pound. So how the fuck am I supposed. To pay this ho just to lay this ho. I know the pussy's mine. So I'mma fuck a couple more times. And then I'm through with it. There's nothing else to do with it. Pass it to the homie, now you hit it. Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me. And y'all know that bitches ain't shit to me. I gives a fuck. Why don't y'all pay attention. Approach her with a different proposition. I'm Kurupt ho. You'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch. It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none. Guess who back in the motherfucking house. With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth. Hoes recognize, niggas do too. Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo. What you gon' do? You really don't know. So I'd advise you not to trust that ho. Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch. Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip. Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger. How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop. Doggy, I'm all the above. I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes. But see it ain't no fun. If my homies can't get a taste of it. Cause you know I don't love em. Woo! Hey, now you know. Inhale, exhale with my flow. One for the money, two for the bitches. Three to get ready and four to hit the switches. In my Chevy, '64 -- red to be exact. With bitches on my side and bitches on my back. So back up, bitch, because I'm struggling.

And every time I try to be, what someone else has thought of me. So caught up, I wasn't able to achieve. But deep in my heart, the answer it was in me. And I made up my mind to define my own destiny. I look at my environment. And wonder where the fire went. What happened to everything we used to be. I hear so many cry for help. Searching outside of themselves. Now I know that his strength is within me. And deep in my heart, the answer it was in me. And deep in my heart.",Lauryn Hill,Hip-Hop,The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,1998.0,negative

(Me a tell you, dem nuh know). (Fi be real, them nuh have a clue!). Beware the false motives of others. Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers. And you never suppose it's those who are closest to you. To you. They say all the right things, to gain their position. Then use your kindness as their ammunition. To shoot you down in the name of amibition, they do. Ohhh. Forgive them father, for. They know not what they do. Why every Indian wanna be the chief? Feed a man 'til he full and he still want beef. Give me grief, try to tief off my piece. Why for you to increase, I must decrease? If I treat you kindly, does it mean that I'm weak? You hear me speak and think I won't take it to the streets. I know enough cats that don't turn the other cheek. But I try to keep it civilized, like Menelik. And other African czars, observing stars with war scars. Get yours in this capitalistic system. So many caught or got bought you can't list them. How you gon' idolize the missing? To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition. Even when they coming, gunning I stand position. L's known the mission since conception. Let's free the people from deception. If you looking for the answers then you gotta ask the questions. And when I let go, my voice echoes through the ghetto. Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto. Why black people always be the ones to settle? March through these streets like Soweto, uhh. Like Cain and Abel, Caesar and Brutus. Jesus and Judus, backstabbers do this. It took me a little while to discover. Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers. Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves, to themselves. A friend once said, and I found to be true. That everyday people, they lie to God too. So what makes you think, that they won't lie to you? (Forgive them, forgive them). Gwan like dem love you, while dem rip you to shreds. Trample pon yuh heart, and leff you fi dead. Dem a yuh friend, who you depend pon, from way back when. ( to grace). But if you, gi' dem yuh back, then you must meet yuh end. Dem nuh know what dem do do. (Who's gonna be the one?). (Gotta be the one to say). Dem nuh know, dem nuh know, dem nuh know, dem nuh know.

Ghetto Qu’ran (Forgive Me),"Ghetto Qu’ran (Forgive Me). Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh. Southside, what y'all niggas know about the dirty South? One time. Lord forgive me, for I've sinned. Over and over again just to stay on top. I recall memories, filled with sin. Over and over again. And again and again and again. When you hear talk of the Southside, you hear talk of the Team. See, niggas feared Prince and respected Preme. For all you slow motherfuckers, I'ma break it down iller. See, Preme was the business man and Prince was the killer. Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh. His hair'll get you seasick, I sat back and peeped shit. The roll with E-Z Wider and they ain't get blunted. Had the whole projects working for 50 on 500. As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack. I used to idolize Cat. Hurt me in my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap. How he go out like that? Rumors in the hood was Just was snitching. I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSXR. Had the 4-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3. Used to drive his truck through the hood dragging jet skis. From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised. Of how freely I throw out names of guys who dealt with pies. Like LA and Wise, L got shot in the neck, then told his connect. Them niggas who shot them got 'em for ten bricks. Fucking Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks. That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on. Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Qu'ran. I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe. And Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose. Throughout my struggles in the hood, I started learning. Life's a bitch with a pretty face, but she burning. Man I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar. Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tah-Tah. Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facing. Go against crews like Bebo and killers like Pappy Mason. A lot of niggas I know been corrupted since birth. Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth. I know some cats that held down whole complexes like Corley Wall. Together niggas stand and divided they fall. Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion. Come around here with your Rollie, you can get robbed like Ocean. Lord knows, Tommy had Laurelton sold. Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior. Might sound like I'm fantasizing, but son I'm dead serious. Montana was no dummy, brought business to wash the money. Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian. Feds couldn't catch him dirty, so settled for tax evasion. Rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about, yo. The twins was from Queens but got crazy cream with Alpo. Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy. Jamaican Pauly, Duckie Corley. Ronnie Bumps and Chick... shit. A lot a niggas flow the way I flow. But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know. Writing rhymes is the best way I express how I feel. If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail. Coming up I heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused. And if you watch the news you see players in this game that lose. I'm forgetting Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance. Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags. In a conversation over shrimp and lobster. At Benihana's, heard Chico stopped boxing, and started robbing diners.

If all it's gonna cause is pain. Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain. So let the river run. He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack. Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched. On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict. And she just wants to exact revenge and get back. It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack.

'Cause she loves danger, psychopath. And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that. But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back. Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand. So she's been on the web lately. Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man. And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care. Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne"". After the first night, but tonight I am. The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain. A one-night stand turned a two-night stand. It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and. He found out, now she feels deserted and used. 'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too. Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through? It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue. Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth. Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you. So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners. Don't have to be reserved in a booth. I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's. Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew. And now that I got you I don't want you.

We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew. To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit. Fuck!. My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh). River (ooh), river run. Call me (ooh), call me (ooh). River (ooh), we'll let the river run. Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!"". Fuck can I say? If life was a highway. And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes. Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe. That's why I may have came at you sideways. I can't keep my lies straight. But I made you terminate my baby. This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled. What else can I say? It was fun for a while. Bet I really woulda loved your smile. Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it.

She don't got no money and wants to get high. Story sounds familiar like born to be wild. But she sillier, not quite the same but she similiar. A waste of a sarsaparilla. Used to look good in the videos now she look hideous. Now it's broken crack pipes with lipstick traces. Work the cold nights red district places. She seen more hotels then my tour suitcases. More male customers than Old Navy. She love limelight more than John Swayze. Seen more miles than a rental, Avis. She don't slow down then some day maybe. She lost then she can't find her way to safety. (Pimpa'ss paradise) That's all she was now. Check it out! She keep her head up in space like a satellite. Because she got a insatiable appetite. For stayin out late night with all the parasites. Plottin on the way to cop a little piece of paradise. Her dignity the only thing that she could sacrifice. Just get the monkey off her back and she be back in like. Five minutes, she stay on the move. She done smoked up the stone that the builder refused. All coked up, alone she ain't even in tuned. And it's sad cause she ain't really have a reason to use. She was a pretty girl cleaner than the board of health, studied and enjoyed herself. I don't know what drove her to avoid herself. Destroyed herself and took a taste of the yay. And now she on the track workin while she wastin away. It's safe to say she lookin for some place to stay. Whoever got a lil' paper to play could get a slice of this... (Background Singers). For no reason a seasoned spliff was the first thing. One spring season while she's out flirtin. Now she season me and don't need rehearsin. Esteem get a beatin', life is uncertain. Ego need feedin now no one's mercy. Beneath the demons she's a warm person. When she's not fiendin swearin and cursin. Behind the curtain she's really hurtin. And while her people don't even trust her at home. The dealer that bring and cook the rock down. And she without sinnin will spot the first stone. The feelin kicks in she's in the dark zone. Old friends walk pass goin bout there own. As if she is someone that they don't know. Then the King Of Kings lift her off the flo'. Sayin life is a thing when you learn you grow. She rise and fall like a star, her life write off like a car. Her face full of all kind of scar, always quick fi start a war. She can't keep herself up to par, she plays like a broken guitar. She always want take it to far. I doubt she ah go make it too far. She rise and fall like a star, her ride off like a car. Her face full of all kind of scar, always with fist start a war.

I have become comfortably numb. Okay (okay, okay, okay...). Just a little pinprick *ding*. There'll be no more... (aah!). But you may feel a little sick. Can you stand up? (stand up, stand up...). I do believe it's working, good. That'll keep you going through the show. Come on, it's time to go. When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse. Out of the corner of my eye.

It Doesn’t Matter,"It Doesn’t Matter. Yo, this is the Rock kicking it with the Refugee camp. And you're bout to smell what the Rock is cookin'. Yo, this is strictly a club record. Dedicated to everybody who used to stand outside in the cold. When the F-L-E-X was spinnin' at the Red Zone, hooded down. And these tired bouncers would not let me in. YouknowwhatI'msayin? Yo, yo, yo. I got fifty Bentley's in the West Indies. (It doesn't matter!). I got a pocket full of cheese and a garden full of trees. I just won the bingo bought a crib in Rio. Cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin. Come up in the hood and they take everything you wearin. Back in the days it was all about the clubs. And the so-called thugs used to dance the break for love. The girls, they wouldn't say HEY!. Unless you bought 'em champagne like it was they birthday. Me, I used to stand outside. Hustlin my way in I'm on the guest list plus five!. Who's performin' tonight? He said Shabba. Mister Lover Daddy he be the selector. (Someone jump the Rock's up in here). Disrespect emcees and catch a smack in your left ear. Light up like Vegas when it's time to gamble. Girls scream for me like I was part of the Beatles. But I'm not honey, but I could be your Paul McCartney. And ""Ebony or Ivory"" into my Jacuzzi. Foundation like Kool Herc, or DJ Red Alert goes bezerk. The needle ain't skip the record jerked. Cause y'all jumpin' too hard. (Hey! Hey! Hey!). What? Yo, 'cause if you ain't sharin', people ain't carin'. Come up in the hood and they take everything you wearin'. Yo, Rock I just bought a fresh Bentley. (It doesn't matter you just bought a fresh Bentley!). How many of y'all ever been to a barbecue. And you always got an aunt or uncle. Wanna show you how the old dances go. And they start it off like this. Electric slide on the dance floor. Freaky-deaky like Studio 54. GIRLS!! Until the IRS raids it. Drug money get converted into music. The dope man becomes an entertainer. Leave that crack alone! I told the customers. I'm into bigger and better things Mr. Fiend. You want a hit? Give me a guitar and a drum machine. And the crowd will scream loud when the bass thump. I can smell it in the air, the smell is funk. {*cough cough*} Excuse me I gotta cough. Girl you wearing so much ice you could freeze New York. Your man must really love you, what does he do for a living? (He works on Wall Street he's only home two nights a week). That's when she said a little too much conversation. Think she want to indulge in lyrical masturbation. So I proceeded with the conversation, I said. Can I offer you a glass of Merlot Mrs. No Name? (Let's get it straight huh, my name's Veronica). She had the ass the size of South America. She said ain't you that kid that sing Guantanamera. Way before Ricky Martin sung ""Livin' La Vida Loca"". What hood you come from? I was raised in Brooklyn, but did my studies in Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem? Yup, that's short for New Jersey. Checked my watch it was a quarter to three. Slid to her crib when we opened the door. Her man was on the bottle waiting for her with the 44. Now what it look like, it ain't really that. So he cocked the gat at my top hat. Are you crazy? You was married!. 'Cause if you ain't sharin', people ain't carin'. Come up in your hood and they take everything you wearin'. Yeah, that's when shorty walked up to her man. And she said I gotta go I can't be here no more. And she said this. Take me home, to the place. I belong at the Refugee Camp. And the Booga Basement. That's where I live, oh. Come on.

Dogs,"Dogs. You got to be crazy, you gotta have a real need. You gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street. You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed. And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight. You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking. And after a while, you can work on points for style. Like the club tie, and the firm handshake. A certain look in the eye and an easy smile. You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to. So that when they turn their backs on you. You'll get the chance to put the knife in. You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder. You know, it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder. As you get older. Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south. Hide your head in the sand. Just another sad old man. All alone and dying of cancer. And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown. And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone. And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around. So have a good drown, as you go down all alone. Dragged down by the stone. (Stone, stone, stone...). Gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused. Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used. Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise. If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze. Deaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending. That everyone's expendable, and no one has a real friend. And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner. Everything's done under the sun. But you believe at heart everyone's a killer. Who was born in a house full of pain. Who was trained not to spit in the fan. Who was told what to do by the man. Who was broken by trained personnel. Who was fitted with collar and chain. Who was given a pat on the back. Who was breaking away from the pack. Who was only a stranger at home. Who was ground down in the end. Who was found dead on the phone. Who was dragged down by the stone.",Pink Floyd,Rock,Shine On,1977.0,negative

We have an APB on an MC Killer. Looks like the work of a master. Evidence indicates that his stature. Merciless like a terrorist hard to capture. The flow changes like a chameleon. Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger. This technique attacks the immune system. Disguised like a lie, paralyzin' the victim. You scream as it enters your bloodstream. Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain. Movin' on a nigga with the speed of a centipede. And injure any motherfuckin' contender.

Deep in the dirt cause you's a sucker. And you ass up high so I can kick the muthafucker. Don't try to hang, you best avoid. Cause my foot will be so far up your ass you'll get hemorrhoids. Before you try to fuck wit Ren. I'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting a size 10. First come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve. Step up and get what you deserve. From the word of a muthafucking hip-hop maniac. Brainiac, so what you oughta do is step the fuck back. Now how the fuck you think a rap will last? Wit your ass saying shit that is said in the past. Yo, be original, your shit is sloppy. Get off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy. Falling deep in the drums so many of styles. Is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles. Cheating and now beating, the crowd I kept seating. But weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating. Styles that kept them full of bull. Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full. They got the nerve to cuss. Only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us. Yo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do. You don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you. You can't harm me, alarm me. Cause we're the generals in this fucking hip-hop army. The niggas wit attitudes if you didn't know. We blow, flow and getting loose slow from the get go, yo. Try us and take it. Yo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in. It's the real thing, you are now real, real niggas, niggas. You can run, but you can't hide, you know I'mma find'cha. Cause a nigga like Ren's only 2 steps behind'cha. Don't look back because you're shaking and all scared. A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare. So sleep wit the lights on, forget that the mic's on. Don't step on my muthafucking stage without nike's on. Don't say it's psycho and then you just might go. Mentally fucked up when I let the right blow. All these niggas wit the jibber jabber. But couldn't kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer. Gangstas in black are out there. But only because, yo, it's the shit that we wear. On my muthafucking dick. But I'mma love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick. So, yo, step off, go to bed, cause if you're mislead. You get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead. Black, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see. A little streetwise nigga, you know me. Rolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps. But you muthafuckas know who run the streets. Wit that hardcore hip-hop rap shit. Now how much harder can another nigga get? Trying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us. Ashes to ashes and dust to dust. So nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please. Since you're on the dick why don't you drop to your knees. Cause I'm a muthafucka that's out to kill. Eazy-E, a nigga that's real. Real niggas, straight off the streets of Compton. Quick to get in your shit without second thought. And if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught. So if you're talking shit about the niggas in black. Bow down to the Kings in Raider hats. They played out, that's what niggas were chanting. One nigga left and they said we ain't happening. People had thought we was finished and then done wit. But if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit. Yet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears. And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas. And when the new record comes, I'll come like a fucking bomb. Asking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb. You're on the dicks of four niggas not one. And when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one. So brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked up. Cause if I let you slide, it's just cause you lucked up. Don't come in my face again, because I'mma floor ya. And if you're a bitch, I'm a fucking ignore ya. Because my attitude's a little bigga. Cause MC Ren is one of the real niggas. Lost in a muthafucking world of madness. Sadness, but Dre is just a nigga that glad there's. Sucka muthafuckas like you, making wack jams. Because it only shows you how dope I am. Never try to ignore us. When I'm expressing, stand still like you're full of rigor mortis. Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure. You can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger. Dre is just a nigga with heart, a nigga that's smart. A nigga that's paid to say what others are scared to play. We started out wit too much cargo. So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold. Yo, N.W.A, criticize for what we say. But I'm a do the shit anyway. Cause I'm the muthafucking doctor, never faking. Yo, Yella, kick the muthafucking break in. N.W.A, straight outta muthafucking Compton. Taking over shit in all of the 1990's. Yo, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, Eazy-E. And I am MC Ren, yo, N.W.A taking over this muthafucka y'all.",N.W.A,Hip-Hop,100 Miles and Runnin’,1990.0,negative

All for a chance to be a star. Nowhere seems to be too far. No more parties in L.A.. Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh. No more (Los Angeles). Please (Shake that body, party that bod-). Please (Shake that body, party that body). Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans. And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan. It was more than soft porn for the K-Man. She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van"". Uhmwell, cutie, I like your bougie booty. Come, Erykah Badu-mewell, let's make a movie. Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler. I show you the ropes, connect the dots. A country girl that love Hollywood. Mama used to cook red beans and rice. Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite. Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection. Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians. R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers. Music and iPhone cameras. This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think. That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean. He flew you in this motherfucker on first class. Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag. Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math? That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck. She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper. I said baby, ""Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards"". You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence. Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is. The head still good, though; the head still good, though. Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"". Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical. Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles. Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal. Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me. Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday. Bottle service, head service, I came in first place. The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek. The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee. And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets. Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity. And yeah, G, I was all for it. She said, ""K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet"". I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie. Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy. Scary, scary. Please, baby, no more parties in L.A.. Friday night, tryna make it into the city. Breakneck speeds, passenger seatsomethin' pretty. Thinking back to how I got here in the first place. Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base. A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds. And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs. Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous. When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list. Strippers get invited to where they only got hired. When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired. I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired. And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir. Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary. I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries. For all my niggas with babies by bitches. That use they kids as meal tickets. Not knowin' the disconnect from the father. The next generation will be the real victims. I can't fault 'em, really. I remember Amber told my boy. No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly. Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'. Of weak content and slow jammin'. But don't worry, this one's so jammin'. You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'. I be thinkin' every day. Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades. I be paranoid every time, the pressure. The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'. My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired. First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died. Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive. That's why I'd rather take the 405. I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim. But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him. Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents. What I'm supposed to do? Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints? Every agent I know, know I hate agents. I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant. Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance. It's just me, I do it my way, bitch. Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans. If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans. I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again. But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans. A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems. Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it. It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out. And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out. Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam. Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam. Thank God for me! (Los Angeles). Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!. I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful. Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful. I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes. I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news. I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house. Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out. We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots. Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop. She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that. She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that. She push me back when the dick go too deep. This good dick'll put your ass to sleep. Get money (Money, money, money)!. Big, big money (Money, money, money!). And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em. Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker!. I just keep on lovin' you, baby. And there's no one else I know can take your pla-, pla-, pla-. Please, no more parties in L.A..

Lullaby,"Lullaby. I spy. Something beginning with 'S'. On candy stripe legs the Spiderman comes. Softly through the shadow of the evening sun. Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead. Looking for the victim shivering in bed. Searching out fear in the gathering gloom. And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room. And there is nothing I can do when I realize with fright. That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight. Quietly he laughs and shaking his head. Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed. And softer than shadow and quicker than flies. His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes. Be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy. Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more. For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light. The Spiderman is having you for dinner tonight. And I feel like I'm being eaten. By a thousand million shivering furry holes. And I know that in the morning. I will wake up in the shivering cold. And the Spiderman is always hungry. 'Come into my parlor,' said the spider to the fly.

And I don't know why your girl keeps pagin' me. She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me. And every time she sees me, she squeeze melady, take it easy!. Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me. I don't want it if it's that easy. Ayo, bust it, baby got a problem saying ""bye-bye"". Just another hazard of a fly guy. You ask ""Why?

Round and round, around we go. I get around, the Underground just don't stop for hoes. I get around, still down with the Underground. I get around, yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know. Now you can tell from my everday fits I ain't rich. So cease and desist with them tricks (tricks). I'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix).

Well, I've been hangin', sangin' tryna do my thang, oh, you heard that I was bangin'. Your homegirl you went to school with? That's cool. But did she tell you about her sister and your cousin?

Fame and fortune is not your forte. Fuck the world now, I'm done with foreplay. Doctor's orders: go fuck yourself. Take two of these in the mornin', overdose and kill yourself. Doctor's orders. Listen, this is my evaluation. This shit oversaturated, y'all can get evacuated. Kids sippin' Actavis and they ain't even activated. Married to the Internet, stuck in place, salivatin'. Ain't nobody graduatin'. Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it. That's why I gotta hate it. Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration. Damn, I'm gettin' aggravated. Fuck, I'm gettin' agitated. Teachers so underpaid in these fuckin' schools. The police got our name in all they databases. Girls be thirteen actin' twenty-two. Niggas be forty-four actin' half they ages. Somebody tell me, what the fuck is goin' on? These niggas in tight shit, I'm in the fuckin' Matrix. It's lookin' like a sign of the revelation. 'Bout time of the return of the fuckin' greatest. I got all these patients, man. How come they ain't patient with me? They just think I want the money. Why? When I can't take it with me. Y'all don't do it for the love, for the love not. They gon' find out who you are. Just admit it 'fore you get admitted. Say, what you livin' about? (Fuck you gon' tell me?).

In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem I was this good scoffed, I just shook off. Prob'ly reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf. Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant. But based on how I ascended. See how plain it was now, they want me to jet. But no one really gave a fuck about my descent, 'til I took off. Mistook me because I looked soft. But I stood tall, I just followed the (Doctor's orders). So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off. Decided opposing you is what I'm 'posed to do, all's. I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls. And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all. You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls. And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone. My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls. And fuckin' goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls. Karma's headed for Armageddon. The drama setter, I'm going in, already got an arm and head in. Whoever said words are just words ain't heard me word 'em. I give a fuck if my image even ends up taking a personal hit.

It's worth it, so Doc turn the beat on. Whose turn is it to get murdered on it? And here's to all the years I spent toein' a line to overtime. As sure as a mole is blind. In my mind I'm still underground as a groundhog. And I'ma go for mine, like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find. No signs of slowin', these lines are my 9's.

If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!). Full magazine could take Staples out. Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account. But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown. Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch. I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'. My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y'all are. To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view. You mention me, millions of views, attention in news. I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you. Billions of views, your ten cents are two. Skim through the music to give shit reviews. To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse. Don't get misconstrued, business as us'. Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do. Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get. What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to. Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow. Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no. Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adios. I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though. Not even dissin', it just ain't for me. All I am simply is just an emcee. Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?). Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean. Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably. Shake the world up if it were up to me. Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill. I should eat a pill, probably I will. Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death. I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath. Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed. Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (""Evil"" spelled). Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick. With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip. Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench. While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch. Like Vice President Mike Pence. Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip. These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic. Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and. Jesus Christ, man, how many times is. Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!). You won't ever see Em icy. But as cold as I get on the M-I-C. I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze. And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it. Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah). Turn down for what? I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa). 'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut. Now when it doesn't matter what caliber. I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks. You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck. Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks? And now he wants to take it out on us"" (Ooouuu). But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy. Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study. It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu). I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that. I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry. Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing). So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'. Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne. I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name. I'm fed up with bein' humble. And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings. I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach. I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo. The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to. What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it? I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two. And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner. If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner. I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it. I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper. You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's. But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival. But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider. Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned. And you woulda bought it. But sayin' I no longer got it. 'Cause you missed a line and never caught it. 'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it. 'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest. With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist. And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless. What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa). Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it. Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic. With a bottle full of malt liquor. But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer. The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom. If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet. I don't see why y'all even started with me. I get in beefs, my enemies die. I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased. I'm east side, never be caught slippin'. Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink. I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats. I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze. ""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage. The Thing ain't even orangeoh my God, that's a reach!"". Shout to all my colorblind people. Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green.

A field of flowers dancing in the spring. A little creek, a tree, an old rope swing. Cotton candy clouds against the blue. First love with all its storm. Raging like fire within. Tossing your heart to chance. You swear the dance will never end. But then it does and someone says goodbye. And after all those empty nights you cried. The morning that you wake up good as new.

But Mary there's a summer drawing to an end tonight. And there's so much that I long to do to you. But in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland. Oo, oo.

And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio. And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow. Saying everything without making a sound. A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon. Standing on your shoes in my bare feet. Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat. Oh whoa, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat. I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest. I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath. You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder. Baby, we won't need a song. We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss. What are we waiting on? Yeah, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat. Saying everything without making a sound, with the. River rolling in the background, underneath a harvest moon.

You don't really think you're gonna get away, do you? We haven't spotted them yet. But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity. A 100 miles and runnin' - MC Ren, I hold the gun and. You want me to kill a mutherfucker and it's done in. Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct -. Is one of the main reasons I don't give a fuck. Chances are usually not good. 'Cause I'm frisked with my hands on a hot hood. And gettin' jacked by the you-know-who. When in a black and white the capacity is two. We're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers. Not wearing medallions, 'cause we're not stupid, mutherfuckers. They're out to take our heads for what we said in the past. Point blank, they can kiss my black ass. I didn't stutter when I said ""Fuck Tha Police"". 'Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace. Now it's broken and can't be fixed. 'Cause police and little black niggas don't mix so. Now I'm creepin' through the fall. Runnin' like a G, we'll see, I might have slayed y'all. So for now pack the gun and. Hold it in the air 'cause MC Ren has a 100 miles of runnin'. In today's news. Four fugitives are on the run. FBI sources tell us that the four are headed. 100 miles to their home base, Compton.

Got the stick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock. That's when the E jumped off the startin' block. A 100 miles from home and, yo, it's a long stretch. A little sprintin' mutherfucker that they won't catch. Yeah, back to Compton again. Yo, it's either that or the Federal pen. 'Cause niggas been runnin' since beginning of time. Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my mutherfuckin' mind. Runnin' like I just don't care. Compton's 50 miles but, yo, I'mma get there. Archin' my back and on a straight route. Just like Carl Lewis I'm ballin' the fuck out. From city to city I'm a menace as I pass by. Rippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm. A straight up nigga that's done in, gunnin' and comin'. Straight at yo ass, a 100 miles and runnin'. This one goes out to the four brothers from Compton. You're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you:. Nowhere to run to, baby. Nowhere to hide. Good luck brothers. Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose. Show me on the news but I hate to be abused. I know it was a set-up - So now I'm gonna get up. Even if the FBI wants me to shut up. But I've got 10 000 niggas strong. They got everybody singin' my ""Fuck Tha Police"" song. And while they treat my group like dirt. Their whole fuckin' family is wearin' our T-shirts. So I'mma run 'til I can't run no more. 'Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score. I got a urge to kick down doors. At my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls. Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'. Dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'. Started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it. So now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it. The number's even - now I'm leavin'. We're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in. Her and the troops are right behind me. But they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me. One more mile to go through the dark streets. Runnin' like a mutherfucker on my own two feet. But you know I never stumble or lag last. I'm almost home so I better haul ass. Tearin' up everything in sight. It's a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight. Now that chase, the shit, is done and.

The police are gonna have to come and get me. Off your ass, that's how I'm going out. For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out. Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble. Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo. Going off on the motherfucker like that. With a gat that's pointed at your ass. So give it up smooth. Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move. Here's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'. With a crime record like Charles Manson. AK-47 is the tool. Don't make me act a motherfucking fool. Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe. I'm knocking niggas out the box, daily. Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly. Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly. That I'm down with the capital C-P-T. Boy, you can't fuck with me. So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck. 'Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck. As I leave, believe I'm stompin'. But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton.

Just like burglary, the definition is jacking. And when I'm legally armed it's called packing. Shoot a motherfucker in a minute. I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it. So if you're at a show in the front row. I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho. You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to. But that shows me, slut, you're not opposed to. A crazy motherfucker from the street. Attitude legit, 'cause I'm tearing up shit. MC Ren controls the automatic. For any dumb motherfucker that starts static. Not the right hand, 'cause I'm the hand itself. Every time I pull an AK off the shelf. The security is maximum, and that's a law. R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw. See, 'cause I'm the motherfucking villain. The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'. That's taking place without a clue. And once you're on the scope, your ass is through. Look, you might take it as a trip. But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip. Straight outta Compton. (Straight outta Compton). Eazy is his name, and the boy is coming. Is a brother that'll smother your mother. And make your sister think I love her. Dangerous motherfucker raising hell. And if I ever get caught, I make bail. See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem. I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him. But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while. And when I see a punk pass, I smile. To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving. But don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling. Looking for the one they call Eazy. But here's a flash, they'll never seize me. Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark. Except when I unload. You see a spark and jump over hesitation. And hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration. Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting. But leave a memory no one'll be forgetting. So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!. You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker. This is an autobiography of the E. And if you ever fuck with me. You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother. Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton.

He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load. Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road. I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals. Smiling like a hero that just received his medal. It was just an old hand me down Ford. With three speed on the column and a dent in the door. I can't replace the way it made me feel and. I would press that clutch. And I'd keep it right. He'd say ""A little slower son, you're doing just fine"". Just a dirt road with trash on each side. But I was Mario Andretti. I'm grown up now, three daughters of my own. I let them drive my old Jeep. Across the pasture at our home. Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file. And pull out that old memory. And think of me and smile and say. It was just an old worn out Jeep. With rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet. A young girl, two hands on the wheel. And he'd say ""Turn it left"" and ""Steer it right"". Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine. Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride. But I was high on a mountain.

Block,"Block. I was down in the city on a miracle street. I flailed like a swimmer through the summer heat. I was waiting for a friend that I needed to meet. And I's hoping she was bringing with her something sweet. And I's hoping for an open little opening. And I suffer for a groovy little happening. But it's all going wrong just like I sing in that song. The song that I wrote about you that they put on TV. The TV that I gave you cuz you wanted to see. But all they saw were spaces where the people used to be. A hundred bastard voids with their pull on me. In the valley of death you'll be breathless and free. You'll be dancing like a fool by the swollen sea. You'll be twitching like a drunk in a pharmacy. You'll be swatting at the flies in your pavilion. Where the millionaire just blew a gazillion. The finger nails are all hot vermilion. And the traffic grinds down to a stand-still-ion. And the mynah birds are pecking at the carrion. And you read it already in Hyperion. And you read about my trial in the Clarion. A sack full of ashes I've been carry'n. When the lights turn green I dissolve the screen. When the lights turn red I put the whole thing to bed. Well I've got a fever. And I'm feeling fainter. I'm a dim receiver. I'm a Cold War painter. If you can just hold still. I will make you all so beautiful. When the lights turn blue I know what to do. I'll drown my tomorrows in an ocean or two. And the pretty little things with their magnets and rings. Blooming like a flower through a series of springs. Thank you Fate and the freight that she brings. Thank you Fortuna and that song that she sings. Thank you to my manager for letting me live. Thank you to my friends and the friends that you're with. Thank you to the lord who created all of this. There's a whole lot of hurt before you get to the bliss. Why even Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss. But that was long before that he got in show biz.

So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah. On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us. So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us. Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia. N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen. N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish. The history books overlook the word and hide it. America tried to make it to a house divided. The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong. So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song. N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more.

Pound the floor, and scream His name. 'Cause we're still worth saving. Can't go on like this, and live like this. We can't love like this. We gotta give this world. Back to God. Have you lost a love? Do you feel like giving up? Has your heart been broken? Are your kids okay? Will they come home safe? Do you lie there hoping? You can make a wish. You can knock on wood. Ohh, it won't do no good.

Still I had to kill a motherfucker last week. He thought I was a punk and tried to creep up on me in my sleep. I just think that I could hold or squeeze or touch or buck ya. But I can't, so fuck it.

What's happenin honey? How you doin? I miss you. Verse 2: LeShaun. The kids keep askin where's their papa? I had to tell em daddy got caught by the coppers. It's time for me to raise em up proper by myself. It's a goddamn struggle when a bitch ain't got no help. Now everybody tellin me that you ain't shit black.

You better stay away from that punk ass bitch, he ain't shit. And I don't wanna have to kill him. Cos think about the times that we used to have. Don't make me reach out and touch that ass. You put yourself in danger when you fuck with a buster. Like shootin dice without a pistol in a circle of murderers. You got more class than the average-type hooker bitch. Don't switch, he gotta grip but he ain't rich. Now I gotta jet, but if you've got the cheque. Give a nigga a look and put somethin on my books. Peace. Verse 4: LeShaun. Aiyo remember the homey with the Lexus, he took the trip to Texas. Now he's wearin the fuckin Lexus like a necklace. So tell me, what's the drill, baby pa? What's a bitch to do? My nigga's stretched in the pen since '92. Them visits ain't doin the trick, drop fucks make me sick. Cos this po' puddy-tat needs a cat nip.

So that you know - I never want to wake. When you're searching your soul. When you're searching for pleasure. How often, pain is all you find. But when you're coasting along and nobody's trying too hard. You can turn around and like where you are. (Yeah and) I hope I never wake. And I close my eyes (dear). Now I'll never never wake.

Red Headed Stranger,"Red Headed Stranger. The red-headed stranger from Blue Rock, Montana. Rode into town one day. And under his knees was a raging black stallion. And walking behind was a bay. The red-headed stranger had eyes like thunder. And his lips, they were sad and tight. His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside. And his heart was heavy as night. Don't cross him, don't boss him. He's wild in his sorrow. He's riding and hiding his pain. Don't fight him, don't spite him. Just wait 'til tomorrow. Maybe he'll ride on again. A yellow-haired lady leaned out of her window. And watched as he passed her way. She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion. But cast greedy eyes on the bay. But how could she know that this dancing bay pony. Meant more to him than life? For this was the horse that his little lost darling. Had ridden when she was his wife. Just wait till tomorrow. The yellow-haired lady came down to the tavern. And looked up the stranger there. He bought her a drink and he gave her some money. He just didn't seem to care. She followed him out as he saddled his stallion. And laughed as she grabbed at the bay. He shot her so quick, they had no time to warn her. She never heard anyone say. ""Don't cross him, don't boss him. ""He's wild in his sorrow. ""He's riding and hiding his pain. ""Don't fight him, don't spite him. ""Just wait 'til tomorrow. ""Maybe he'll ride on again"". The yellow-haired lady was buried at sunset. The stranger went free, of course. For you can't hang a man for killing a woman. Who's trying to steal your horse.

Don't perceive his empty plea. That redundant effigy. Take in view his empty stool. What's left is satin cool. Clawing adornment for his crimes. They saw they had to draw the line.

You're the first who ever make me fall in love and then not take me.,Loretta Lynn,Country,Loretta Lynn Writes ’em and Sings ’em,,negative
I Will Always Love You,"I Will Always Love You. If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go, but I know. I'll think of you each step of the way. And I will always love you. I will always love you. Bittersweet memories. That's all I'm taking with me. Goodbye, please don't cry. We both know that I'm not what you need. But I will always love you. I hope life treats you kind. And I hope that you have all. That you ever dreamed of. And I wish you joy and happiness. But above all this, I wish you love.",Dolly Parton,Country,Jolene,1973.0,positive
Youth of Eglington,Youth of Eglington. The youths of Eglinton. Won't put down their Remington. The youth of Brixton. They have their 45 Smith and. Wesson pistol pistol. The youth of Utica Avenue.

Only Love,"Only Love. Shaggy. (Yo it's Pitbull). Mr. Worldwide. Let's show the world how powerful love it. (Now we spread love around the world). Round and round and round we go. Waiting for the wind to blow. As we walk this world alone. Only love can bring us home. Waving powerless and blind. But tomorrow, we'll be kind. Let love guide us through the rain. Forget our yesterday. Only love, love, love. Brings us together. Love, forever. Only love, forever and ever. Only love can conquer all and move mountains. When you cold, only love makes you warm again. Only love heals a broken heart, we been through. It all girl, came through the storm again. Find your joy, let go of the past. Love invade your walls like the Trojan horse again. Can't give up, won't give in, find the strength from within. Ask yourself, can you lose my heart again? I know you're hurting but baby let my love set you free. I'll never let you fall, let's go, girl you can trust in me. Forever in my eyes, you will always be the one for me. I'll always love you until they read out my eulogy. Love heals all, love kills war. I love the hustle but I love you more. Ride or die that's what love is for. Believe it or not, God loves us all. When I was down and out. You were down with me. Things got deep, you'd drown with me. If there was heat, I know you'd cock back. Click, clap, spit a round with me. Blow a pound with me, hold it down with me. To all them haters, they can come get and me. It's us against the world, 150 I love Miami. That's my city, 305. It's all good, all good. Love is love, love is love. Shaggy, Pitbull, dale. It's all on us. Only love, forever, babe.",Shaggy,Reggae,,,positive
4th Of July,"4th Of July. Shower in the dark day. Clean sparks driving down. Cool in the waterway. Where the baptized drown. Naked in the cold sun. Breathing life like fire. Thought I was the only one. But that was just a lie. Cause I heard it in the wind. And I saw it in the sky. And I thought it was the end. And I thought it was the 4th of July. Pale in the flare light. The scared light cracks & disappears. And leads the scorched ones here. And everywhere no one cares. The fire is spreading. And no one wants to speak about it. Down in the hole. Jesus tries to crack a smile. Beneath another shovel load. I heard it in the wind. And I thought it was the 4th of July (July, July). Now I'm in control. Now I'm in the fall out. Once asleep but now I stand. And I still remember. Your sweet everything. Light a Roman candle. And hold it in your hand. Yeahhhhhh.",Soundgarden,Rock,Superunknown ,1994.0,negative
Stay With Me,"Stay With Me. Books and covers and part time lovers. Spinning in rooms in cities of rust. I'm stranded, struck out on this line. There's smoke and fire and steel and wire. And glass and spire and dust. One to the floor at dawn with lips tied and drawn. Sleepless nights spent, with angels heaven sent. Stay with me, lay with me, lay down by my side. Stay with me, lay with me, take me deep inside. Lay with me, stay with me, lay with me. Stay, with me. All of us lying there in the dreams. Speak of days and another place. I wander as the gypsy under a beckoning moon. Speak of time, and another face. They would in languid cry a fleeting furtive sigh. From the cradle to the grave love to desire and crave. I'll laugh for you, and I'll dance for you. But don't ask me to she'd any tears when I have to go. You are a joy and a pleasure to love and to hold. Your promises, are as pure as the driven snow. Passing shapes in the night the touch distraut and light. As you brightly shine, your love tonight is mine.",The Mission UK,Rock,God’s Own Medicine,1986.0,positive
It Was Written,"It Was Written. And it was written. Up in the book of life. That a man shall. Endure forever more. Well did you know the pen. Is stronger than the knife. And they can kill you once. But they can't kill you twice. Did you know destruction of the flesh. Is not the ending to life. Fear not of the anti-christ. Did you know that I. Exist before the earth. And did you know my eyes. Are windows to the world. Did you know you can't go to Zion and wear jerry curls. Can't tell the boys from the girls. Your body's just a vehicle. Transporting yo' soul. It's what's inside ah people. Is beauty to behold. Fear not of evil. Everyday dem flesh it grow old. Changes of the times take the toll. The one ya name, fear is in the eyes of the beholder. And love is in the presence of the love maker. Life is in the words of the comforter. Endure much longer, live much longer. Fear is in the eyes of the beholder. A vest around his chest and Rastafari is his name. The gift of everlasting life for us to all sustain. Blessing that you all begot. Lessons that you all forgot. Rasta call it shit you not. Do you remember Elijah. And his chariot of flames. Same blood that runs thru my veins. Fear is in the eyes of di beholder. Careful how you entertain stranger. Selassie never born inna nuh manger. And I'm never crucify as nuh savior. Elect off himself inna the ruler. Babylon ah nah malfunction well dem a failure. So be careful of dem cellular and pager. Cause I sign see dem I see danger. So dem great but Selaisse I greater. Me think me wanna lick upon shots. Upon a bloodclot. And fill the block with bumbaraas cops. Cops mi dun talk you know you watch me walks in. While black woman is getting raped across New Yorks And. Before another brother's in chalks And. I imagine somebody said that's your son dead, see him? See us we do the crime we do the time. Y'all get away scott-free. So police mi gonna pop you before you pop me. Cause if you get me you got me you shot me. Know'll lot me carry shotty since moms slap me. Cause my room sloppy. The youngest nigga out the camp is me. But nobody pampered me. So you better don't ramp with me. Fi see me, me don't play plenty. Chicks me blazed many. Raised plenty fi dollars. Storm upon mi prada. Watch a bomb holla. Watch 'im run, hit the floor. Told I'm come, come no. Throw ya ganja pon de air. 'plah!'. So watch for sticks and stones, stumbling blocks in piles. Life is one big road, miles on top of miles. So blessed be the soul that always remains a child. When most people don't even smile. There's a natural mystic, blowing tru the air. So keep it realistic, and always be aware. The truth is crying out, and it's so loud and so clear. But most people won't even hear. Spiritual pollution in the atmosphere. And with so much confusion, can one be happy here. The gift of Rastafari is for all man to share. But some would rather to be so unfair.",Damian Marley,Reggae,Halfway Tree,2012.0,negative
