Homely Girl,"Homely Girl. It must have broke your poor little heart. When the boys used to say. You looked better in the dark. But now they'd give all they learnt in school. To be somewhere in the dark with you. The teacher would ask the questions. And you, would always raise your hand. But somehow you never got your turn. And my eyes would fill with water, inside I'd burn. Homely girl, you used to be so lonely. You're a beautiful woman oh homely girl. Homely girl you used to be so lonely. There was a boy who used to sit beside you. Who'd like to hold that place his whole life through. Oooh you were beautiful to me. You had a heart no one could ever see, oh yes you did. I was the only one who offered. To carry your books. Took all the stares and laughter. And the dirty looks. Cause I saw then what they see now. They all want to ask you for a date. They don't know how, they don't know how. Homely girl. You used to be so lonely.",UB40,Reggae,Labour of Love II,,positive
Special K,"Special K. Coming up beyond belief. On this coronary thief. More than just the light motif. More chaotic, no release. I'll describe the way I feel. Weeping wounds that never heal. Can the savior be for real. Or are you just my seventh seal? No hesitation, no delay. You come on just like Special K. Just like I swallowed half my stash. And never ever wanna crash. You come on just like Special K. Now you're back with dope demand. I'm on sinking sand. Gravity, no escaping. Gravity. Not for free. I fall down, hit the ground. Make a heavy sound. Every time you seem to come around. You're my new Achilles' heel. No escaping gravity.",Placebo,Rock,Black Market Music,2000.0,negative
That’s Entertainment,"That’s Entertainment. A police car and a screaming siren. Pneumatic drill and ripped-up concrete. A baby wailing, a stray dog howling. The screech of brakes and lamplight blinking. That's entertainment. A smash of glass and the rumble of boots. An electric train and a ripped-up phone booth. Paint-splattered walls and the cry of a tomcat. Lights going out and a kick in the balls. I say that's entertainment. La la la la la, ah. Days of speed and slow-time Mondays. Pissing down with rain on a boring Wednesday. Watching the news and not eating your tea. A freezing cold flat with damp on the walls. La la la la la. Waking up at 6 A.M. on a cool warm morning. Opening the windows and breathing in petrol. An amateur band rehearsing in a nearby yard. Watching the telly and thinking 'bout your holidays. Waking up from bad dreams and smoking cigarettes. Cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume. A hot summer's day and sticky black tarmac. Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were far away. Two lovers kissing masks a scream of midnight. Two lovers missing the tranquility of solitude. Getting a cab and travelling on buses. Reading the grafitti about slashed-seat affairs.",The Jam,Rock,Sound Affects,1980.0,positive
Because of You,"Because of You. I will not make the same mistakes that you did. I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery. I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard. I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far. Because of you. I never stray too far from the sidewalk. I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt. I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me. Because of you, I am afraid. I lose my way. And it's not too long before you point it out. I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes. I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh everyday of my life. My heart can't possibly break. When it wasn't even whole to start with. I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep. (I watched you die in your sleep). I was so young. You should have known better than to lean on me. (I was too young for you to lean on me). You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain. (You never saw me). And now I cry in the middle of the night. For the same damn thing.",Reba McEntire,Country,Reba: Duets,2007.0,negative
If I Had Only Known,If I Had Only Known. If I had only known. It was the last walk in the rain. I'd keep you out for hours in the storm. I would hold your hand. Like a life line to my heart. Underneath the thunder we'd be warm. It was our last walk in the rain. I'd never hear your voice again. I'd memorize each thing you ever said. And on those lonely nights. I could think of them once more. Keep your words alive inside my head. You were the treasure in my hand. You were the one who always stood beside me. So unaware I foolishly believed. That you would always be there. But then there came a day. And I turned my head and you slipped away. It was my last night by your side. I'd pray a miracle would stop the dawn. And when you'd smile at me. I would look into your eyes. And make sure you know my love. For you goes on and on. The love I would've shown.,Reba McEntire,Country,For My Broken Heart,1991.0,negative

Oh for sho'. Yeah. Check me out. It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga. Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot. 'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock.

Since I left ain't too much changed, still. I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world. (Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl. Still takin' my time to perfect the beat. And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.. Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends. Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again. Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem. He's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week. Still, I stay close to the heat. And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet. My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat. Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I sleep. Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat. I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat. It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth. Since ""Turn Off the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin Cru. I'm still at it, after mathematics. In the home of drive-by's and ak-matics. Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic. I dip through, then I get skin, D.R.E.. It ain't nothin' but more hot shit. Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with. Whether you're coolin' on the corner with your fly bitch. Laid back in the shack, play this track. I'm representin' for the gangstas all across the world.

Dr. Dre be the name, still runnin' the game. Still got it wrapped like a mummy. Still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money. Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood. Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard. Barbeques every day, drivin' fancy cars. Still gon' get mine regardless (Still). Right back up in your mothafuckin' ass. 9-5 plus four pennies! Add that shit up. D.R.E. right back up on top of thangs. Smoke some with your Dogg. No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!. Some of that real sticky icky icky. Ooh wee! Put it in the air!.

Something You Get Through,"Something You Get Through. When you lose the one you love. You think your world has ended. You think your world will be a waste of life. Without them in it. You feel there's no way to go on. Life is just a sad, sad song. But love is bigger than us all. The end is not the end at all. It's not somethin' you get over. But it's somethin' you get through.

Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'. Damn, who are we right now? Can we have a little conversation? Figure it out with no intoxication. We carry on, what is our motivation? We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it? Maybe we're used to this. Tell me, what are we to do? It's like we only play to lose. Chasin' pain with an excuse. I love that shit and so do you.

Life Goes On,"Life Goes On. How many brothers fell victim to the streets? Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G. Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death.

Plus this my homie from high school, he gettin' by. It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry. Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls. We used to do 'em as adolescents, do you recall? Raised as G's, loc'ed out, and blazed the weed. Get on the roof, let's get smoked out, and blaze with me. Two in the morning and we still high, assed out. Screamin', ""Thug 'til I die!"" before I passed out. But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone. Thinkin' I don't wanna die all alone, but now you gone. And all I got left are stinkin' memories. I love them niggas to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessy. While tryin' to make it last. I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed, 'cause life goes on. My niggas, we the last ones left, and life goes on. Yeah nigga, I got the word it's hell. You blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L. Time to prepare to do fed time, won't see parole. Imagine life as a convict that's gettin' old. Plus with the drama, we're lookin' out for your baby's mama. Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her. Life in the hood is all good for nobody. Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at yo' party. Me and you, no truer two, while schemin' on hits. And gettin' tricks that maybe we can slide into. But now you buried rest, nigga, 'cause I ain't worried. Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery. Though memories fade. I got your name tatted on my arm. So we both ball 'til my dyin' days. Before I say goodbye. Kato and Mental, rest in peace! Thug 'til I die!. My niggas, we the last ones left, 'cause life goes on. Bury me smilin' with G's in my pocket. Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it. Let the hoes that I used to know. From way befo' kiss me from my head to my toe. Give me a paper and a pen, so I can write about my life of sin. A couple bottles of gin, in case I don't get in. Tell all my people I'm a Ridah. Nobody cries when we die, we Outlawz, let me ride. Until I get free. I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me. To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews. Niggas that guided me through back in the old school. Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies. See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me. And brothers miss you while you gone. You left your nigga on his own; how long we mourn? Life goes on. Life goes on, homie. Gone on, 'cause they passed away. Niggas doin' life. Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit. I feel you, nigga, trust me, I feel you. You know what I mean? Last year we poured out liquor for ya. This year, nigga, life goes on, we're gonna clock now. Get money, evade bitches, evade tricks. Give playa haters plenty of space. And basically just represent for you, baby. Next time you see your niggas, we gon' be on top, nigga. You gon' be like, ""Goddamn, them niggas came up!"". That's right, baby, life goes on.

When I bit off more than I could chew. But through it all when there was doubt. I ate it up and spit it out. I faced it all and I stood tall. And did it my way. I've loved, I've laughed and cried. I've had my fill, my share of losing. And now as tears subside. I find it all so amusing. To think I did all that. And may I say, not in a shy way. Oh, no, no not me.

How's everybody doing tonight? I'd like to welcome to the stage. The lyrically acclaimed. I like this young man, because when he came out. He came out with the phrase. He went from ashy to classy I like that. So everybody in the house. Give a warm round of applause for The Notorious B.I.G. The Notorious B.I.G. Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for him y'all!. Uh, a nigga never been as broke as me, I like that. When I was young, I had two pair of Lees, besides that. The pin stripes and the gray. The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays. While niggas flirt, I'm sewing tigers on my shirts, and alligators. You want to see the inside? I see you later. Here comes the drama, oh. That's that nigga with the fake, blaow. Why you punch me in my face? Stay in your place. Play your position, here come my intuition. Go in this nigga pocket, rob him while his friends watchin'. And hoes clockin', here comes respect. His crew's your crew or they might be next. Look at their man eye, big man, they never try. So we rolled with them, stole with them. I mean loyalty, niggas bought me milks at lunch. The milks was chocolate, the cookies, butter crunch. '88 Oshkosh and blue and white dunks, pass the blunts. Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on. Just keep on pressing on. Sky is the limit and you know that you can have. What you want, be what you want. Have what you want, be what you want. I was ashamed, my crew was lame. I had enough heart for most of them. Long as I got stuff from most of them. It's on, even when I was wrong, I got my point across. They depicted me the boss, of course. My orange box-cutter make the world go round. Plus I'm fucking, bitches ain't my homegirls now. Start stacking, dabbled in crack, gun packing. Nickname Medina make the seniors tote my ninas. From gym class to Ingles pass off a global. The only nigga with a mobile, can't you see like Total. Getting larger in waists and tastes. Ain't no telling where this felon is headin', just in case. Keep a shell at the tip of your melon, clear the space. Your brain was a terrible thing to waste. '88 on gates, snatch initial name plates. Smokin' spliffs with niggas, real-life beginner killers. Praying God forgive us for being sinners, help us out. After realizin', to master enterprisin'. I ain't have to be in school by ten. I then began to encounter with my counterparts. On how to burn the block apart. Break it down into sections, drugs by the selections. Some use pipes, others use injections. Syringe sold separately, Frank the Deputy. Quick to grab my Smith & Wesson like my dick was missing. To protect my position, my corner, my lair. While we out here, say the Hustlers Prayer:. ""If the game shakes me or breaks me. I hope it makes me a better man, take a better stand"". Put money in my mom's hand. Get my daughter this college plan so she don't need no man. Stay far from timid, only make moves when your heart's in it. And live the phrase ""Sky's the limit"".

More Than a Memory,"More Than a Memory. People say she's only in my head. It's going to take time but I'll forget. They say I need to get on with my life. They don't realize. Is when you're dialing 6 numbers just to hang up the phone. Driving across town just to see if she's home. Waking a friend in the dead of the night. Just to hear him say it's going to be alright. When you're finding things to do not to fall asleep. Because you know she will be there in your dreams. That's when she's more than a memory. Took a match to everything she ever wrote. Watched her words go up in smoke. Tore all her pictures off the wall. That ain't helping me at all. Because when you're talking out loud but nobody's there. You look like hell and you just don't care. Drinking more than you ever drank. Sinking down lower than you ever sank. When you find yourself falling down upon your knees. Praying to god, begging him please. She's more. Because when you're dialing her number just to hang up the phone. Waking a friend in the dead of night. Just to hear him say it's gonna be alright.

When I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways. The pain gets so much clearer. When the one to blame is standing in the mirror. This fool, this liar. Lit a match and set his life on fire. I guess I'd rather be alone, in a house that's not a home. The pain in my heart's 'cause we're a thousand miles apart. I've got no one to blame for the shame. 'Cause she's waiting back home. I hope she's waiting back home. Stupid to think that I could blame it on the drink. Now I'm trying to stall, making calls to someone back home. I hope there's someone back home.

Set Your Piggies Free,"Set Your Piggies Free. There are times we choose to wear our shoes. Feet need to be protected. But when it's safe to go without, here's something unexpected. Those little piggies on your feet, they love to wiggle free, exploring nature, skin to earth, footloose and fancy wee-wee-wee-wee. All the way home. Set your piggies free. It's time to lose those socks and shoes and set your piggies free. Set your piggies free, exploring naturally. The greatest way to do it is to really get into it and set your piggies free. Take off your shoes. Feel the morning dew. Let the cool breeze blow in between each toe. Make a barefoot stand in the soft, warm sand. And don't forget to let your feet get wet. Watch out, little piggies. That water's cold. So set your piggies free. At times you're going to need a shoe. Your foot's just got to wear it. But when there's nature to explore, then you got to grin and ""bare"" it. Not that kind of bear feet. I'm talking bare feet. Set your piggies. I got to set my piggies. You got to do it.

The Old Rugged Cross,The Old Rugged Cross. On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross. The emblem of suffering and shame. And I love that old cross where the dearest and best. For a world of lost sinners was slain. So I'll cherish the old rugged cross. Till my trophies at last I lay down. I will cling to the old rugged cross. And exchange it some day for a crown. To the old rugged cross I will ever be true. It's shame and reproach gladly bear. Then he'll call me some day to my home far away. Where his glory forever I'll share.

Vision Thing,"Vision Thing. *sniff*. Twenty-five whores in the room next door. Twenty-five floors and I need more. I'm looking for the can in the candy store. Two thousand Hamburg four. And colours I ain't seen before. It's a small world and it smells funny. I'd buy another if it wasn't for the money. Take back what I paid. For another motherfucker in a motorcade. In a long black car. With the prettiest shit. From Panama. When the sirens wail. And the lights flash blue. My vision thing come. Slamming through. It's a small world and it smells bad. I'd buy another if I had. Back. What I paid. What do we need to make our world come alive? What does it take to make us sing? While we're waiting for the next one to arrive? One million points of light. One billion dollar vision thing. Another black hole in the killing zone. A little more mad in the methedrome. One blinding flash of sense. Just like the president's. Well, I don't mind. Out of my mind. Blizzard king. Bring it on home. And a vision thing. And a . Sha la la la. What do we need to make us sing?",The Sisters of Mercy,Rock,Vision Thing,,negative

Pretending that you're loc'in but you're broken, let me get you open. Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life. And Tamikra around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe. The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money. And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny. But who's the dummy, cause, now you done lost the hustler. A down-ass brother done been replaced by a buster. And though I got love for ya, I know I can't trust ya. Cause my crew is rollin hummers and your crew is rollin dusters. And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more. Uh, I guess that's just the way it goes. I ain't tryin to preach, I believe I can reach. But your mind ain't prepared, I'll see you when you get there. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there. See you when you get there. More temptation than faith, I guess we livin for the day. I seen a man get swept off his feet, by a boy with an AK. The situation so twisted everybody gettin lifted. I'm just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business. Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention. So you don't get caught slippin when they come and do all the gettin. Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart. Some of us gotta run a little faster cause we gotta later start. I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender. If everybody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner. No matter your rag color, deep down we all brothers. And regardless of the time, somebody up there still love us. I'mma scuffle and struggle until I'm breathless and weak. I done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak. Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something. I'll be there when you get there waitin with the sounds bumpin. You need to loosen up and live a little. And if you got kids let them know how you feelin. For your own sake give a little. Oh, you don't want to hear that, you busy tryina stack. And keep up with the Joneses, takin advantage of your own. The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest. But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone. Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us. We prefer to keep our eyes shut till it's right. When there's something involved that we desire. So hold your head up high if you're poor and righteous. I know times seem strife, and problems seem endless. But at the times of despair we gotta put ourselves together. And if you feel you're out of the game then you need to get back in it. Cause nothing worse than a quitter. You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother. So wrap up your pity and turn it to ambition. And put your vehicle in 'drive' and stop by my side. As we walk down the road of our destiny. And the time comes to choose which shall it be. The wide and crooked, or the straight and narrow. We got one voice to give and one life to live. Stand up for something or lie down in your game. Listen to the song that we sing. It's up to you to make it big. I guess I'll see you when you see me. - to fade.",Coolio,Hip-Hop,My Soul,2005.0,negative

Changes,"Changes. I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself. Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself? I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black. My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch. Cops give a damn about a negro. Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero. ""Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares? One less hungry mouth on the welfare!"". First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers. Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other. ""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said. Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead. I got love for my brother. But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other. We gotta start makin' changes. Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers. And that's how it's supposed to be. How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? I'd love to go back to when we played as kids. But things change and that's the way it is. That's just the way it is. Things'll never be the same. That's just the way it is, aww yeah. I see no changes, all I see is racist faces. Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races. We under, I wonder what it takes to make this. One better place, let's erase the wasted. Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right. 'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight. And the only time we chill is when we kill each other. It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other. And although it seems heaven-sent. We ain't ready to see a black president. It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact. The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks. But some things will never change. Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game. Now tell me, what's a mother to do? Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you. You gotta operate the easy way. ""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way. Sellin' crack to the kids. ""I gotta get paid!"" well hey, but that's the way it is. We gotta make a change. It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes. Let's change the way we eat. Let's change the way we live. And let's change the way we treat each other. You see the old way wasn't workin'. So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive. And still I see no changes; can't a brother get a little peace? It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East. Instead of war on poverty. They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me. And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do. But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you. Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up. Crack you up and pimp-smack you up. You gotta learn to hold your own. They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone. But tell the cops they can't touch this. I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this. That's the sound of my tool. You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool. And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped. And I never get to lay back. 'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback. Some buck that I roughed up way back. Comin' back after all these years. ""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is.

The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers. So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em. The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?

And influence a generation that's lacking in patience. I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience. Just me and my old man getting back to basics. We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted. When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing. Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas. We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us. We even talked about you and our couple of moments. He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups.

You don't even know what you want from love anymore. I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored. But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh? Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures. Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage. When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit. A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it. 'Cause that night I played her three songs. Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on. Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz. Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off. Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria. Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria. Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music. When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it. The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree. I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me. Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment? Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't. Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz. Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision. Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions. When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven. It seem like you don't want this love anymore. I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore. ""Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G. Been a East Side ting. Scarborough ting from time, G.

Elvis in the ground, no way he'll be here tonight. Income tax deduction, one hell of a function. Now the daughters and the sons. Unwillingness to claim us, ya got no war to name us. The ones who love us best are the ones we'll lay to rest. And visit their graves on holidays at best. The ones who love us least are the ones we'll die to please. If it's any consolation, I don't begin to understand them. Daughters and the sons. Young...take it, it's yours.",The Replacements,Rock,Tim,,negative

Rodeo,"Rodeo. His eyes are cold and restless. An' his wounds have almost healed. And she'd give half of Texas. Just to change the way he feels. She knows his love's in Tulsa. An' she knows he's gonna go. Well, it ain't no woman flesh and blood. It's that damned old rodeo. Well, it's bulls and blood, it's dust and mud. It's the roar of a Sunday crowd. It's the white in his knuckles, the gold in the buckle. He'll win the next go 'round. It's boots and chaps, it's cowboy hats. It's spurs and latigo. It's the ropes and the reins, and the joy and the pain. And they call the thing rodeo. She does her best to hold him. When his love comes to call. But his need for it controls him. And her back's against the wall. And it's ""So long girl, I'll see you"". When it's time for him to go. You know the woman wants her cowboy. Like he wants his rodeo. It'll drive a cowboy crazy. It'll drive a man insane. And he'll sell off everything he owns. Just to pay to play her game. And a broken home and some broken bones. Is all he'll have to show. For all the years that he spent chasin'. This dream they call rodeo. It's the broncs and the blood, it's the steers and the mud.",Garth Brooks,Country,Ropin’ the Wind,1991.0,positive

Mommy rocked the babies at night. And read the Bible by the coal oil light. And everything would start all over come break of morn. Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay. Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard everyday. Why I've seen her fingers bleed, to complain there was no need. She's smiled in mommy's understanding way. In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear. But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair. From a mail order catalog, money made from selling a hog. Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere. Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter. I remember well the well where I drew water. The work we done was hard.

Synthetic world,"Synthetic world. Hey you, I'm up from the bayou. Where wildlife runs free. You could say that I'm country. But let me tell you what I see. Your world is plastic. Can see through to the other side. Your cities are made of wood. Antiques are what you've got inside. Houses are paper but folks don't hear a word you say. Friendship's like acid. It burns, burns, burns as it slides away. So you see, my patience is growin' thin. With this synthetic world we're livin' in. The word imitation is goin' cross the nation. What's real has become a freak. Someone's tryin' to make me weak. Strange initials to keep me blind. Psychedelic music to blow my mind. Spray to clear the air and its filled with spray. Makin' people die every day. Now I find I'm out of place. If I only have one face. All my friends have more than two. No longer must you be you. They found out how to transplant.

Stan,"Stan. My tea's gone cold. I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window. And I can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad. Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'. I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom. I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em. There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'. Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em. But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter? My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father. If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? I'ma name her Bonnie. I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry. I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him. I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan. I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam. I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man. I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat. Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back. Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan. Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance. I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans. If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to. But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew. That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old. We waited in the blisterin' cold. For you, for four hours, and you just said no. That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol. He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do. I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to. Remember when we met in Denver? You said if I'd write you, you would write back. See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither. He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her. I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs. So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on. 'Cause I don't really got shit else. So that shit helps when I'm depressed. I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest. Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds. It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me. See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it. My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7. But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does. She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up. You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose. Sincerely yours, StanP.S. : We should be together too. Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans. This'll be the last package I ever send your ass. It's been six months, and still no wordI don't deserve it? I know you got my last two letters. I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect. So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it. I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway. Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive? You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night"". About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'. But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him? That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'. Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers nowI'm drowsy. And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call. I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall. I loved you, Slim, we coulda been togetherthink about it!. You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it. And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it. I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me. See, Slimshut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk. Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk. But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her upSee? I ain't like you. 'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too. Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now. Oh, shit, I forgothow am I supposed to send this shit out?!. Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy. You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she? Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that. And here's an autograph. For your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap. I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you. Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you. But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too? I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you? You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'. To help your ass from bouncin'. Off the walls when you get down some. And what's this shit about us meant to be together? That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other. I really think you and your girlfriend need each other. Or maybe you just need to treat her better. I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time. Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine. If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan. Why are you so mad? Try to understand. That I do want you as a fan. I just don't want you to do some crazy shit. I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick. Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge. And had his girlfriend in the trunk. And she was pregnant with his kid. And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to.

Coward Of The County,"Coward Of The County. Everyone considered him. The coward of the county. He'd never stood one single time. To prove the county wrong. His mama named him Tommy. But folks just called him yellow. Something always told me. They were reading Tommy wrong. He was only ten years old. When his daddy died in prison. I looked after Tommy. Cause he was my brother's son. I still recall the final words. My brother said to Tommy. Son my life is over, but yours has just begun. Promise me, son. Not to do the things I've done. Walk away from trouble if you can. Now it don't mean you're weak. If you turn the other cheek. And I hope you're old enough to understand. Son, you don't have to fight to be a man. There's someone for everyone. And Tommy's love was Becky. In her arms he didn't have. To prove he was a man. One day while he was working. The Gatlin boys came calling. They took turns at Becky. N'there was three of them. Tommy opened up the door. And saw his Becky crying. The torn dress, the shattered look. Was more than he could stand. He reached above the fireplace. Took down his daddy's picture. As a tear fell on his daddy's face. He heard these words again. The Gatlin boys just laughed at him. When he walked into the barroom. One of them got up. And met him half way cross the floor. Tommy turned around they said. ""Hey look, old yella's leavin'"". But you could've heard a pin drop. When Tommy stopped and locked the door. Twenty years of crawling. Was bottled up inside him. He wasn't holding nothing back. He let 'em have it all. Tommy left the bar room. Not a Gatlin boy was standing. He said, ""This one's for Becky"". As he watched the last one fall. N' I heard him say. I promised you, Dad. Not to do the things you've done. I walk away from trouble when I can. Now please don't think I'm weak. I didn't turn the other cheek. Papa, I sure hope you understand. Sometimes you gotta fight. When you're a man.",Kenny Rogers,Country,Kenny,1979.0,positive

In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes. But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back. Up front there ought to be a man in black. I wear it for the sick and lonely old. For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold. I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been. Each week we lose a hundred fine young men. And, I wear it for the thousands who have died. Believing that the Lord was on their side. I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died. Believing that we all were on their side.

Don't want to sing in a strange land no. Liberation true democracy. One God one aim one destiny. Remember when we used to dress like kings. Conqueror of land conqueror of seas. Civilization far moved from caves. Oppressor man live deh. I curse that day. The day they made us slaves I say. Don't want to sing in a strange land. Red gold black and green. A bright shining star--Africa. Catch star liner right now--Africa. A history no more a mystery--Africa. Respect and authority--Africa. Climb ye the heights of humanity.

Drinking Alone,"Drinking Alone. (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh). Let me make one thing clear. You can buy me a beer, but you ain't taking me home. No pick up lines, I came here tonight to shed a few tears on my own. But sitting there across the room. I couldn't help but notice you seem a little down on your love too. Yeah, my heart might be breaking. But, this seat ain't taken. And you've got me thinkin'. We should be drinking alone, together. Drownin' the pain is better. With somebody else who got problems. We ain't gonna solve 'em. But misery loves company. Tonight all I need is a stranger. Lips with a whiskey chaser. And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone. Oh, we should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh). We should be drinking alone, together (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh). I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this. But, I know just what to do. It starts with a bottle of good Reposado. And ends with a shooter or two. Tomorrow when the sun comes up. Tonight's the night that never was. Baby, just forget my name. Won't be your one and only. But just 'cause we're lonely, don't mean that we should. We should be drinking alone. 'Cause drownin' the pain is better. Oh, we should be drinking alone. Drinking alone, drinking alone (Together). Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (We should be drinking alone). Drinking alone, drinking alone. Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone. I'll pretend that I care. Baby, pull up a chair. We'll stay here 'til they make us go home. We should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh). Oh, we should be drinking alone, together. Oh, we should be drinking alone (Drinking alone, drinking alone) together. Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh). Ooh, ooh, ooh.",Carrie Underwood,Country,Cry Pretty,2018.0,positive
Mausoleum,"Mausoleum. Wherever you go I will be carcass. Whatever you see will be rotting flesh. Humanity recovered glittering etiquette. Answers her crimes with mausoleum rent. Regained your self-control. And regained your self-esteem. And blind your success inspires. And analyse, despise and scrutinise. Never knowing what you hoped for. And safe and warm but life is so silent. For the victims who have no speech. In their shapeless guilty remorse. Obliterates your meaning. Your meaning, your meaning. No birds - no birds. The sky is swollen black. Holy mass of dead insect. Come and walk down memory lane. No one sees a thing but they can pretend. Life eternal scorched grass and trees. For your love nature has haemorrhaged. ""I wanted to rub, uhm, the human face in its own vomit, and force it to look in the mirror."". And life can be as important as death. But so mediocre when there's no air, no light and no hope. Prejudice burns brighter when it's all we have to burn. The world lances youth's lamb-like winter, winter.",Manic Street Preachers,Rock,The Holy Bible,1994.0,negative
That’s That Shit,"That’s That Shit. Yeah, that's right, I like that. (""The royal penis is clean your highness""). Thank you, uh, uh. Snoop, Kells. You know how we get down. I pull up, whip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'. Ladies like ""That's that shit"". I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees. Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit. In the spot where the girls go wild. Dancing titty bar style, I'm like ""That's that shit"". Snoop Dizzle (hey) your boy Kells (hey). Let me hear you say ""That's that shit"". Let's get this party jumpin', me and Kel' gon' get it bumpin'. They humpin' like when it's over, we gon' all get into somethin'. The Dogg is fresh, Southside without a vest. Nothin on my chest but these ladies up out the Midwest. I must confess that in the Chi you're so blessed. Leaving nothing on my mind but Doggy, you and safe sex. This ain't a test, you fucking with a cold mess. Meet me in Chicago, let me get you to this real west. It's real strong, real fat and real long. Doggies in the building, holdin' something they can feel up on. And once they get it something they can build up on. Take that skinny nigga home, work that filling till it's gone. Get that home grown, put that shit on Daddy long. I know how you ladies do it, t-shirt with no panties on. Let's get this shit crackin', Kell and Doggy Dogg in action. If you in here all alone, you might get this dog bone. Snoop Dizzle (hey), your boy Kells (hey). Dippin' low, '64, hundred spokes and chronic smoke. All these ladies on the floor cause they know what we in here for. Dogg and Kelly came to ball, get your ass up off the wall. Let that middle wiggle now make that shit fall. Not just one but all y'all, move it like you want it all. Let me see you bounce it for me, work that shit for Doggy Dogg. You gots to do it, is that your crew? Bring 'em too, come here let me take you through it. Then once Kelly get into it, we can get this after party. Poppin' everybody, got themselves another body. Knockin' out without protection though, that's my confession. But at the spot if you just think you want a lesson, you can drop it like it's hot. Hold up, I came to cool out, lay back and get blown. Maybe Henny, maybe gin, a couple shots of Patron. And if you didn't you missed it but now it's known. That this that shit, Kels sing that song, come on. So if you think you got the bomb shit. Holla at a playa. And if you lookin' for some good sex. Girl if you ever in the 3-1-2. And if you're ever in the 2-1-3.",Snoop Dogg,Hip-Hop,Tha Blue Carpet Treatment Mixtape,2006.0,positive
Double Dare,Double Dare. I dare you to be real. To touch. To touch a flickering flame. The pangs. The pangs of dark delight. Don't cower. Don't cower in night fright. Don't back away just yet. From destinations set. I dare you to be proud. To dare to shout aloud. For convictions that you feel. Like sound from bells to peal. I dare you to despise. Bureaucracy and all its lies. In the void. In the void they stare. They never. They never dared to dare. I dare. I dare you. You. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I dare you.,Bauhaus,Rock,In the Flat Field,1980.0,positive
POWER,"POWER. I'm living in that 21st Century, doing something mean to it. Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it. Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it. I guess every superhero need his theme music. No one man should have all that power. The clock's ticking, I just count the hours. Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power. (21st-Century schizoid man). The system broken, the school is closed, the prison's open. We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling. Huh? Motherfucker, we rolling. With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands. In this white man world, we the ones chosen. So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning. I'll see you in the morning. This is way too much, I need a moment. 'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours. And they say, and they say. Fuck SNL and the whole cast. Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass. More specifically, they can kiss my asshole. I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes. You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon. My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in. And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic. He knows, he's so fucking gifted. I just needed time alone with my own thoughts. Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault. My childlike creativity, purity and honesty. Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts. Reality is catching up with me. Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody. With these responsibilities that they entrusted me. As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece. Thinking no one man should have all that power. Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder. Colin Powells, Austin Powers. Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation. They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation. Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation. At the end of the day, god damn it, I'm killing this shit. I know damn well y'all feeling this shit. I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick. I ain't gotta power trip, who you going home with? How 'Ye doing? I'm surviving. I was drinking earlier, now I'm driving. Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hiding? I got the power to make your life so exciting. (So excitso excitso excitso excit). Now this will be a beautiful death. I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go. I'm letting everything go. Letting everything go. You got the power to let power go?",Kanye West,Hip-Hop,My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,2010.0,negative
“Heroes”,"“Heroes”. I, I will be king. And you, you will be queen. Though nothing will drive them away. We can beat them, just for one day. We can be heroes, just for one day. And you, you can be mean. And I, I'll drink all the time. 'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact. Yes, we're lovers, and that is that. Though nothing will keep us together. We could steal time, just for one day. We can be heroes, forever and ever. What d'you say? I, I wish you could swim. Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim. Though nothing, nothing will keep us together. We can beat them, forever and ever. Oh, we can be heroes, just for one day. We can be us, just for one day. I, I can remember (I remember). Standing, by the wall (By the wall). And the guns shot above our heads (Over our heads). And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (Nothing could fall). And the shame was on the other side. Oh, we can beat them, forever and ever. Then we could be heroes, just for one day. We can be heroes. We're nothing, and nothing will help us. Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay. But we could be safer, just for one day. Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, just for one day.",David Bowie,Rock,“Heroes”,1977.0,positive
Genocide,"Genocide. Stone cold killers in these Compton streets. One hand on the 9, all eyes on me. Murder, murder, murder, murder. Call 9-1-1, emergency. Hands up in the air for the world to see. It's murder, it's murder, murder, murder (Murder). Murda dem down, kill 'em dead (Yo!). Bullet to the dome, to the head. Murda dem down kill a yout'. Don fe pull up on de man and. (Turn me up!) What it look like? See, murda dem down, kill 'em dead (Yo!). Bullets come down from the air. Murda dem down, kill a yout'. What it look? There's the stone cold killers in these Compton streets. Murder, murder, it's murder, it's murder. It's been a 187 in this bitch!. Murder this, murder listen, hit a suburban whippin'. Tinted windows, right at your wifey (Brrrat!). And I bet you miss her. Reload the protools and we throw the clip in both trays. That's one on the left and one in the right hand. Scottie Pippen both ways. Been doin' drive-bys, got this music industry timeline. Lookin' like Rosecrans when these niggas throw up them signs high. I'm talkin' about that bottom where it's high crimes. Shit, I'm just tryna get paid and keep 'em thighs high. Sometimes I feel like I could just bury 'em, bury 'em. Cause delirium, mass hysteria, scarier area. I'm very aware hip hop needed somethin' to carry it. So I married that bitch and swung down in that chariot. Hangin' way too fuckin' close, beware the barrier. This is Hub City, nigga, don't make us embarrass you. Man, you should be realistic, these niggas 'round here ballistic. We did the numbers and you lookin' like another statistic. Ahh, shit! Recognize what lives inside these eyes. I'ma ride until the dead has risen. Live in a project building, dodgin' the module ceilings. I ride, I'ma ride in a stolen Jeep. Ride with the eyes of five blind men, my vision (Corrupted). Mama tried counselin', five plans for Kendrick (But fuck it). My family's ties, had sabotaged Rosecrans existence (Abducted). My aliens on surveillance, they paid me a visit (Disgusting). Our stadium's packed, Raiders in black. Curls drippin', silver bullet, palladium in my strap. I lie on the side of a one way street. Nowhere to go, death all I can see. I say ""Fuck is up? "", I fuck 'em up. Your supper's up or something's up. I hoping all get orthotist, rope it before the double dutch broke. Plenty ruckus with the weapon I protect it under oath. My discretion, fuck your blessing, fuck your life. Fuck your hope, fuck your mama. Fuck your daddy, fuck your dead homie. Fucked the world up when we came up, that's Compton homie!. Murder, murder.

Under the Milky Way,"Under the Milky Way. Sometimes, when this place gets kind of empty. Sound of their breath fades with the light. I think about the loveless fascination. Under the Milky Way tonight. Lower the curtain down on Memphis. Lower the curtain down, alright. I got no time for private consultation. Wish I knew what you were looking for.

The Greatest Man I Never Knew,The Greatest Man I Never Knew. The greatest man I never knew. Lived just down the hall. And everyday we said hello. But never touched at all. He was in his paper. I was in my room. How was I to know he thought I hung the moon. Came home late every night. He never had too much to say. Too much was on his mind. I never really knew him. And now it seems so sad. Everything he gave to us took all he had. Then the days turned into years. And the memories to black and white. He grew cold like an old winter wind. Blowing across my life. The greatest words I never heard. I guess I'll never hear. The man I thought could never die. He's been dead almost a year. He was good at business. But there was business left to do. He never said he loved me. Guess he thought I knew.,Reba McEntire,Country,For My Broken Heart,,negative
