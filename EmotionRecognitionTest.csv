Big town's got its losers Small town's got its vices A handful of friends: One needs a match, one needs some ice Call-waiting phone in another time zone  How do you say I miss you to an answering machine? How do say good night to an answering machine? (If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again If you need help, hang up and then dial the number...) I get enough of that  Try and free a slave of ignorance Try and teach a whore about romance  How do you say I miss you to an answering machine? How do you say good night to an answering machine? How do you say I'm lonely to an answering machine? The message is very plain Oh, I hate your answering machine I hate your answering machine I hate your answering machine  (If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again...

Everyone I know Goes away in the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt  I wear this crown of thorns Upon my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear You are someone else I am still right here  What have I become My sweetest friend?

Alan Jackson,Country,Where Were You (When The World Stopped Turning),Drive,2001.0,"Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day? Were you in the yard with your wife and children Or working on some stage in L.A.? Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke Rising against that blue sky? Did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor Or did you just sit down and cry? Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones And pray for the ones who don't know? Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble And sob for the ones left below? Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue And the heroes who died just doing what they do? Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer And look at yourself and what really matters?  I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell You the difference in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us And the greatest is love  Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day? Were you teaching a class full of innocent children Or driving down some cold interstate? Did you feel guilty because you're a survivor In a crowded room did you feel alone? Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her? Did you dust off that Bible at home? Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened Close your eyes and not go to sleep? Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages Or speak to some stranger on the street? Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow Or go out and buy you a gun? Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns? Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers Did you stand in line and give your own blood? Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family Thank God you had somebody to love?
