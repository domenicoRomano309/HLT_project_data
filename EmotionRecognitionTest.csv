Lauryn Hill,Hip-Hop,When It Hurts so Bad,The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,1998.0,"When It Hurts so Bad. When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad). Why's it feel so good? (when it hurts so bad). (When it hurts so bad). I loved real, real hard once. But the love wasn't returned. Found out the man I'd die for. He wasn't even concerned. I tried, and I tried, and I tried. To keep him in my life (to keep him in my life). I cried, and I cried, and I cried. But I couldn't make it right. But I, I loved the young man. And if you ever been in love. Then you'd understand. That what you want might make you cry. What you need might pass you by. If you don't catch it (if you don't catch it). (if you don't catch it). And what you need ironically. Will turn out what you want to be. If you just let it (if you just let it). See, I thought this feeling. It was all that I had. But how could this be love. And make me feel so bad? (gave up my power). Gave up my power. I existed for you. But who-ever knew. The voo-doo you'd do. See what you want might make you cry. So bad (when it hurts so bad).",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0
Kendrick Lamar,Hip-Hop,"Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst","good kid, m.A.A.d city (Deluxe Version)",2012.0,"Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst. When the lights shut off and it's my turn. To settle down, my main concern. Promise that you will sing about me. I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn. I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you. In case I'm not here tomorrow. I'm hopin' that I can borrow. A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important. My mind is really distorted. I find nothing but trouble in my life. I'm fortunate you believe in a dream. This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine. And last night was just another distraction. Or a reaction of what we consider madness. I know exactly what happened. You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help. Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel. Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up. But the type of bullet that stuck. Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands. My plan's rather vindictive. Everybody's a victim in my eyes. When I ride it's a murderous rhythm. And outside became pitch black. A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!"". I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck. That same mentality I told my brother not to duck. In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors. I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover. The life that I knew as a youngin. In pajamas and dun-ta-duns. When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb. Niggas like me never prosper. Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted. This Piru shit been in me forever. So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever. And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did. Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big. And if I die before your album drop, I hope. You wrote a song about my sister on your tape. And called it Section.80. The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby"". What's crazy was I was hearin' about it. But doubted your ignorance. How could you ever just put her on blast and shit? Judgin' her past and shit? Well, it's completely my future. Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit. And I'ma need that forty dollars. Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow. In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed. By a married man, and father of three. My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys. Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's. He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week. This is the life of another girl damaged by the system. These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em. See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em. Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim. Of a family gene that show women how to be woman. Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'. Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught. Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed. And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit. My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain. If you can't fit the pumps I walk in? I'll wait Your rebuttal a little too late. And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song. 'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own. And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great? A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight. I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away. I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate. And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'. I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'. You lyin' to these motherfuckers. Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story. You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga. Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit. Sometimes I look in the mirror. And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away? If it's today, I hope I hear a. Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon. With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus. I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'. The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance. With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed. May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons. I suffer a lot. And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch. I tie my stomach in knots. And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death. My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats. That can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful. And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch. Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death. Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest. And you're right, your brother was a brother to me. And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me. In a direction to speak on somethin'. That's realer than the TV screen. By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between. Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told"". Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul. Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'. Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's. I count lives, all on these songs. Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong. Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong. And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone. Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in? Promise that you'll sing about me forever. Promise that you'll sing about me for ooooh. (On the phone). ""Ay, ay, ay, Where you 'bout to go?"". ""Nigga, the homie's brother-- nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!"". ""Nigga-- they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga."". ""Al- alright, nigga-- nigga just come-- alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back."". ""Arghh... Fuck!. So what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?"". ""Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like... nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga. We can go back right now"". ""Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!"". Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'. My own kind, but retirin' nothin'. Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'. Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't. Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst? Dope on the corner, look at the coroner. Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her. Stray bullets, AK bullets. Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't. Bring her back, who got the footage? Channel 9, cameras is lookin'. It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked. Banana clip, split his banana pudding. I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding. I know I'm good at. Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst. How many sins? I'm runnin' out. I lost count. Dreams of ballin' like Spalding. But only shotty bounce. The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth. Money is power (Money is power). Yours is ours (Yours is ours). Lay with a snitch, die with a coward. Hope we get rich, hope we can tower. Over the city with vanity with the music louder. The same song, a black flower. I'll show you how to. Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst. What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'? Hell is hot, fire is proven. To burn for eternity, return of the student. That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it. Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'. Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'. Now back to business, loadin' the guns in. Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'. The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion. Hereditary, all of my cousins. Too many sins, I'm runnin' out. Somebody send me a well for the drought. See all I know is takin' notes. On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke. My best days, I stress days. (Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know). Say ""fuck the world,"" my sex slave. Money, pussy, and greed what's my next crave? Whatever it is, know it's my next grave. Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'. Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' backwards. My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise. What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished? The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest. You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst. So hop in that water, and pray that it works."". Fuck! I'm tired of this shit!. I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit!. That's my brother, homie!. Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is? I know that's not what I think that is. Why are you so angry? See, you young men are dying of thirst. Do you know what that means? That means you need water, holy water. You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord. Do you want to receive God as your personal savior? Okay, repeat after me:. ""Lord God, I come to You a sinner."". (Lord God, I come to You a sinner). ""And I humbly repent for my sins."". (And I humbly repent for my sins). ""I believe that Jesus is Lord."". (I believe that Jesus is Lord). ""I believe you raised Him from the dead."". (I believe you raised Him from the dead). ""I would ask that Jesus come into my life."". (I would ask that Jesus come in my life). ""And be my Lord and Savior."". (And be my Lord and Savior). ""I receive Jesus to take control of my life."". (I receive Jesus to take control of my life). ""And that I may live for Him from this day forward."". (And that I may live for Him from this day forward). ""Thank you, Lord Jesus. For saving me with Your precious blood."". (Thank you, Lord Jesus. For saving me with Your precious blood). ""In Jesus name, amen."". (In Jesus name, amen). Alright now, remember this day.

Johnny Cash,Country,Man in Black,Man In Black,,"Man in Black. Well, you wonder why I always dress in black. Why you never see bright colors on my back. And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone. Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on. I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down. Living in the hopeless, hungry side of town. I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime. But is there because he's a victim of the times. I wear the black for those who've never read. Or listened to the words that Jesus said. About the road to happiness through love and charity. Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me. Well, we're doing mighty fine, I do suppose. In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes. But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back. Up front there ought to be a man in black. I wear it for the sick and lonely old. For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold. I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been. Each week we lose a hundred fine young men. And, I wear it for the thousands who have died. Believing that the Lord was on their side. I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died. Believing that we all were on their side. Well, there's things that never will be right I know. And things need changing everywhere you go. But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right. You'll never see me wear a suit of white. Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day. And tell the world that everything's okay. But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back.

It's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone. And remember that you feel. I said it's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone. Again I stand, Lord I stand. Against the Faceless Man. Now I saw a face on the water. It looked humble but willing to fight. I saw the will of a warrior. His yoke is easy and his burden is light. He looked me right in the eyes. Direct and concise to remind me. To always do what's right. Again I stand, Lord God I stand. Because if the face inside can't see the light. I know I'll have to walk alone. And if I walk alone to the other side. I know I might not make it home. Next time I see this face. I'll say I choose to live for always. So won't you come inside.

Prosecuting attorneys are; MC Ren, Ice Cube. And Eazy-motherfucking-E. Order, order, order!. Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth. And nothing but the truth so help your black ass? You goddamn right!. Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say? Fuck the police! Comin' straight from the underground. A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown. And not the other color, so police think. They have the authority to kill a minority. Fuck that shit 'cause I ain't the one. For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun. To be beating on and thrown in jail. We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell. Fuckin' with me 'cause I'm a teenager. With a little bit of gold and a pager. Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product. Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics. You'd rather see me in the pen. Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o. Beat a police out of shape. And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape. To tape off the scene of the slaughter. Still getting swole off bread and water. I don't know if they fags or what. Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts. And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none. But don't let it be a black and a white one. 'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top. Black police showing out for the white cop. Ice Cube will swarm. On any motherfucker in a blue uniform. Just 'cause I'm from the CPT. Punk police are afraid of me. Huh, a young nigga on the warpath. And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath. Of cops, dying in L.A. Yo, Dre, I got something to say. Fuck tha police!. Pull your goddamn ass over right now!. Aww shit, now, what the fuck you pullin' me over for? 'Cause I feel like it!. Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!. Man, fuck this shit!. A'ight, smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!. MC Ren, will you please give your testimony. To the jury about this fucked up incident? And Ren said it with authority. Because the niggas on the street is a majority. A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'. And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in. A stash spot, for the so-called law. Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw. Lights start flashing behind me. But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me. But that shit don't work, I just laugh. Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path. For police, I'm saying, ""Fuck you, punk!"". Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk. Pulling out a silly club, so you stand. With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand. But take off the gun so you can see what's up. And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up!. Make you think I'ma kick your ass. But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast. I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime. But I'ma smoke them now and not next time. Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me. Or any asshole that threatens me. I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope. Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me. The motherfuckin' villain that's mad. With potential to get bad as fuck. So I'ma turn it around. Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound. (Gunshot sounds). Yeah, somethin' like that. But it all depends on the size of the gat. Taking out a police would make my day. But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say. (Knocking sounds). Yeah, man, what you need? Police, open out!. Aww, shit. We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest. Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!. (Move, motherfucker, move now!). What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do? Just shut the fuck up. And get your motherfucking ass on the floor!. (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!). But I didn't do shit. Man, just shut the fuck up!. Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand. And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit? I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'. Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and. Shining the light in my face, and for what? Maybe it's because I kick so much butt. I kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast. On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger. Of an Uzi or an AK. 'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say. They put out my picture with silence. 'Cause my identity by itself causes violence. The E with the criminal behavior. Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor. Without a gun and a badge, what do you got? A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot. By me, or another nigga. And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger. (Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool!). And as you all know, E's here to rule. Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror. And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a. Dumb motherfucker with a gun. And if I'm rollin' off the 8, he'll be the one. That I take out, and then get away. While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say. The verdict:. The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck. White bread, chickenshit motherfucker. Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!. Get him out of here!. I want justice!. Get him the fuck out my face!. Out, right now!. Fuck you, you black motherfuckers!.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1

Where can a soldier fix himself a drink. Forget the noise, forget the stink. And the opium is running pretty low. 'Cause when the pain comes back, I don't want to know. Across yonder ocean the natives are fierce. Their ears are filled their teeth are pierced. But it's not their spears that spill your breath. They kill their enemies by loving them to death. We were on some battlefield. I felt something soft go through my shield. I felt something warm enter my guts. I was bleeding bad but there were no cuts. They captured three of us, took us back to their village. After a long long time I could decipher their language. They worshipped Baal, they worshipped the sun. They worshipped the son of the evil one. They were more than voracious, they sucked our ambition. They let me go on one condition. That was when I came back to my native shore. I tell you they don't want to play with us anymore. But a part of me will never be free. And the part that's free will never be me. But a thing of love and beauty is in my head. A message from my enemies, and here's what they said. They said that love = hate. And death = fate. An enemy always = an adorer. But priest = aura. And life = time. And time = space. And space = sublime. And human = race. Oh and woman = man. And pot = pan. The fauna ought to equal the flora. And beginning = the end. The end always = the start. But straight = bent. The mind sometimes = the heart. And you = me. The land = the sea. Richer = poorer. And priest = aura.",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1

I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses. Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries. Lyrically perform armed robbery. Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me. Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when my pen hits tremendous. Ultraviolet shine blind forensics. I inspect you through the future see millennium. Killa Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum. Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics. Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths. Black Wu jackets, Queen Beez ease the guns in. Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function. Heads by the score take flight, incite a war. Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more. Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly. Proceeds to blow, swinging swords like Shinobi. Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock. Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block. As the world turns, I spread like germ. Bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard-headed never learn. This my testament to those burned. Play my position in the game of life standing firm. On foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan. Into the fire, transform into the Ghost Rider. A six-pack and A Streetcar Named Desire. Who got my back. In the line of fire holding back? My peoples if you with me, where the fuck you at? Niggas is strapped and they're tryna twist my beer cap. It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm. Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm. What the blood clot? We smoke pot. And blow spots, you want to think twice? I think not. The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from. Guns of Navarone tearing up your battle zone. Rip through your slums. I twist darts from the heart, tried and true. Loop my voice on the LP. Martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox. Vocabulary 'Donna talking, tell your story walking. Take cover kid, what? Run for your brother, kid. Run for your team and your ""six can't rhyme"" groupies. So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted. My deadly notes reign supreme, your thought is basic compared to mine. Domino effect, arts and crafts, paragraphs contain cyanide. Take a free ride on my thought. I got the fashion catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God. The saga continues. Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang. Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet. The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat. We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for. Judgment Day cometh, conquer, it's war. Allow us to escape Hell, globe spinning bomb. Pocket full of shells out the sky Golden Arms. Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound. The fake false step make the blood stain the ground. A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum. A death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem. Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anaesthesias. My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas. My music Sicily, rich California smell. An axe kill adventure, paint a picture well. I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sipping on ginseng. Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings. March of the wooden soldiers, C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us. A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober. Perpendicular to the square we stay in gold like Flair. Escape from your dragon's lair. In particular my beats travel like a vortex. Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex. Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex. Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream. Heart terminal like Grand Central Station. Program fat basslines on Novation. Getting drunk like I'm fucking ducking five-year probation. War of the masses, the outcome disastrous. Many of the victim families save their ashes. A million names on walls, engraved in plaques. Those who went back received penalties for the acts. Another heart is torn as close ones mourn. Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song. The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds. And leaks sounds that's heard. 93 million miles away from. Came one to represent the Nation. This is a gathering of the masses. That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan. As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage. The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage. Light is provided through sparks of energy. From the mind that travels in rhyme form. Giving sight to the blind. The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum. Death only one can save self from. This relentless attack of the track spares none. Yo yo yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back. Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack. Codeine was forced in your drink. You had a navy green salamander fiend, bitches never heard you scream.

It's Earth, 93 million miles from the first. Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz. Aiyo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk. Connect thoughts to make my man child walk. Swift notarizer, Blue-Tang, all up in the high-riser. New York Yank visor, word tranquilizer. Adjust the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives.

This is the stylin' for a title that sounds silly. But nothin' silly about the triflin' times of Millie. Millie a Brooklyn Queen originally from Philly. Complete with that accent that made her sound hillbilly. Around this time the slammin' joint was ""Milk is Chillin'"". But even cooler was my social worker Dillon. Yeah I had a social worker 'cuz I had some troubles. Anyone who'd riff on me, I'd pop their dome like bubbles. He'd bring me to his crib to watch my favorite races. That's how his daughter Millie became one of my favorite faces. She had the curves that made you wanna take chances. I mean on her, man, I'd love to make advances. I guess her father must 'a got the same feelin'. I mean, actually findin' his own daughter Millie appealing. At the time no one knew but it was a shame. That Millie became a victim of the touchy-touchy game. Yo Millie, what's the problem, lately you've been buggin'. On your dookie earrings, someone must be tuggin'. You were a dancer who could always be found clubbin'. Now you're world renowned with the frown you're luggin'. Come to think your face look stink when Dill's around you. He's your father-what done happen-did he ground you? You shouldn't flip on him 'cuz Dill is really cool. Matter of fact, the coolest elder in the school. He hooked up a trip to bring us all the Lacey. He volunteered to play old Santa Claus at Macy's. Child, ya got the best pops anyone could have. Dillon's cool, super hip, you should be glad. Yeah, it seemed that Santa's ways were parallel with Dillon. But when Millie and him got home, he was more of a villain. While she slept in he crept inside her bedroom. And he would toss her and then would force her to give him head room. Millie tried real hard to let this hell not happen. But when she'd fuss, he would just commence the slappin'. (Yo Dillon man, Millie's been out of school for a week, man, what's the deal?). I guess he was givin' Millie's bruises time to heal. Of course he told us she was sick and we believed him. And at the department store as Santa we would see 'em. And as he smiled, his own child was at home plottin'. How off the face of this earth she was gonna knock him. When I got home, I found she had tried to call me. My machine had kicked to her hey how ya doin' (sorry). I tried to call the honey but her line was busy. I guess I'll head to Macy's and bug out on Dillon. I received a call from Misses Sick herself. I asked her how was she recoverin' her health. She said that what she had to ask would make it seem minute. She wanted to talk serious, I said, ""go ahead-shoot"". She claimed I hit the combo dead upon the missile. Wanted to know if I could get a loaded pistol. That ain't a problem but why would Millie need one. She said she wanted her pops Dillon to heed one. Ran some style about him pushin' on her privates. Look honey, I don't care if you kick five fits. There's no way that you can prove to me that Dill's flip. He might breathe a blunt but ya jeans he wouldn't rip. You're just mad he's your overseer at school. No need to play him out like he's someone cruel. She kicked that she would go get it from somewhere else. Yeah, whatever you say, go for ya self. Macy's department store, the scene for Santa's kisses. And all the little brats demandin' all of their wishes. Time passes by as I wait for my younger brother. He asks his wish, I waste no time to return him back to Mother. As I'm jettin', Millie floats in like a zombie. I ask her what's her problem, all she says is ""Where is he?"". I give a point, she pulls a pistol, people screamin'. She shouts to Dill, ""He's off to hell cuz he's a demon!"". None of the kids could understand what was the cause. All they could see was a girl holdin' a pistol on Claus. Dillon pleaded mercy, said he didn't mean to. Do all the things that her mind could do nothing but cling to. Millie bucked him and with the quickness it was over.",0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1

If you ain't peeped then you must be drinkin and smokin. Pretending that you're loc'in but you're broken, let me get you open. Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life. And Tamikra around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe. The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money. And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny. But who's the dummy, cause, now you done lost the hustler. A down-ass brother done been replaced by a buster. And though I got love for ya, I know I can't trust ya. Cause my crew is rollin hummers and your crew is rollin dusters. And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more. Uh, I guess that's just the way it goes. I ain't tryin to preach, I believe I can reach. But your mind ain't prepared, I'll see you when you get there. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there. See you when you get there. More temptation than faith, I guess we livin for the day. I seen a man get swept off his feet, by a boy with an AK. The situation so twisted everybody gettin lifted. I'm just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business. Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention. So you don't get caught slippin when they come and do all the gettin. Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart. Some of us gotta run a little faster cause we gotta later start. I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender. If everybody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner. No matter your rag color, deep down we all brothers. And regardless of the time, somebody up there still love us. I'mma scuffle and struggle until I'm breathless and weak. I done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak. Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something. I'll be there when you get there waitin with the sounds bumpin. You need to loosen up and live a little. And if you got kids let them know how you feelin. For your own sake give a little. Oh, you don't want to hear that, you busy tryina stack. And keep up with the Joneses, takin advantage of your own. The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest. But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone. Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us. We prefer to keep our eyes shut till it's right. When there's something involved that we desire. So hold your head up high if you're poor and righteous. I know times seem strife, and problems seem endless. But at the times of despair we gotta put ourselves together. And if you feel you're out of the game then you need to get back in it. Cause nothing worse than a quitter. You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother. So wrap up your pity and turn it to ambition. And put your vehicle in 'drive' and stop by my side. As we walk down the road of our destiny. And the time comes to choose which shall it be. The wide and crooked, or the straight and narrow. We got one voice to give and one life to live. Stand up for something or lie down in your game. Listen to the song that we sing. It's up to you to make it big. I guess I'll see you when you see me. - to fade.",0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1

Power and the money, money and the power. Minute after minute, hour after hour. Everybody's running, but half of them ain't lookin'. What's going on in the kitchen? But I don't know what's cookin'.

And Emmylou got caught passing me a note. Before the teacher took it, I read what she wrote. ""Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend? And if you do. Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand. If you want to. I think this is how love goes, check yes or no"". Now we're grown up and she's my wife. Still like two kids with stars in our eyes.

Willie Nelson,Country,Me And Paul,Yesterday’s Wine,,"Me And Paul. It's been rough and rocky traveling. But I'm finally standing upright on the ground. After taking several readings. I'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound. I guess Nashville was the roughest. But I know I've said the same about them all. We received our education. In the cities of the nation, me and Paul. Almost busted in Laredo. But for reasons that I'd rather not disclose. But if you're staying in a motel there and leave. Just don't leave nothing in your clothes. And at the airport in Milwaukee. They refused to let us board the plane at all. They said we looked suspicious. But I believe they like to pick on me and Paul. On a package show in Buffalo. With us and Kitty Wells and Charlie Pride. The show was long and we're just sitting there. And we'd come to play and not just for the ride. Well, we drank a lot of whiskey. So I don't know if we went on that night at all. But I don't think they even missed us. I guess Buffalo ain't geared for me and Paul.",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0
Alan Jackson,Country,Where Were You (When The World Stopped Turning),Drive,2001.0,"Where Were You (When The World Stopped Turning). Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day? Were you in the yard with your wife and children. Or working on some stage in L.A.? Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke. Rising against that blue sky? Did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor. Or did you just sit down and cry? Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones. And pray for the ones who don't know? Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble. And sob for the ones left below? Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue. And the heroes who died just doing what they do? Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer. And look at yourself and what really matters? I'm just a singer of simple songs. I'm not a real political man. I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell. You the difference in Iraq and Iran. But I know Jesus and I talk to God. And I remember this from when I was young. Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us. And the greatest is love. Were you teaching a class full of innocent children. Or driving down some cold interstate? Did you feel guilty because you're a survivor. In a crowded room did you feel alone? Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her? Did you dust off that Bible at home? Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened. Close your eyes and not go to sleep? Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages. Or speak to some stranger on the street? Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow. Or go out and buy you a gun? Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching. And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns? Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers. Did you stand in line and give your own blood? Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family. Thank God you had somebody to love?",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

The Cure,Rock,Killing an Arab,Boys Don’t Cry,1978.0,Killing an Arab. Standing on the beach. With a gun in my hand. Staring at the sea. Staring at the sand. Staring down the barrel. At the arab on the ground. I can see his open mouth. But I hear no sound. I'm alive. I'm dead. I'm the stranger. Killing an arab. I can turn. And walk away. Or I can fire the gun. Staring at the sky. Staring at the sun. Whichever I chose. It amounts to the same. Absolutely nothing. I feel the steel butt jump. Smooth in my hand. Staring at myself. Reflected in the eyes. Of the dead man on the beach. (The dead man on the beach).,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1
