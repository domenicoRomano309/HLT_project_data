Nirvana,Rock,You Know You’re Right,Nirvana,2002.0,I will never bother you. I will never promise to. I will never follow you. Never speak a word again. I will crawl away for good. I will move away from here. You won't be afraid of fear. No thought was put into this. And always knew it would come to this. Things have never been so swell. I have never failed to fail. He-eee-eee-eeey. He-eee-eee-eey. He-eee-eee-ey. You know you're right. I'm so warm and calm inside. I no longer have to hide. Let's talk about someone else. Steaming soup against her mouth. Nothing really bothers her. She just wants to love himself. Always knew it'd come to this. (He-eee-eee-eey). You know your rights.,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
The Mission UK,Rock,Jade,Another Fall from Grace,2016.0,"She came as Lolita dressed as Venus. And adorned with Stars. With her deft allusion and a Universe between Us. She showed me her skill with words and I showed her my Scars. Don't mistake kindness for affection, she said. Don't ever let the attention go to your Head. No more let Death divide what Life can join Together. But just remember there is nothing that can last Forever. And Jade is Benediction. She is silent Prayer. And Jade is Exaltation. The colours that I wear. And Jade is Contradiction. She is naked but never bare. Jade is a Work, a work of Fiction. Nothing more than Castles in the Air. The shorter the leash the harder I will pull. My glass is Empty when once it was Full. I wish I could be Jesus and turn water into Wine. 'Cause all my grapes have withered, withered on the vine. With a smile like Mercury, elusive and fey. There's a Beauty in the night that can't be seen by day. She's a barbed wire Angel insatiable and cruel. She destroys my resistance like the most Dazzling Jewel. And Jade is Apostasy. Abandoned Faith and Hope. Jade is Hypocrisy. She is Kaleidoscope. And Jade is Precious Stone. Impervious and Rare. And Jade will never atone. For the Flowers in her Hair. And Jade never sleeps alone. There's always someone there. With Jade. To rest their Head on her thigh. To make her moist when she is dry. To hold the Breath of every sigh. To pledge their Life and how to Die. To kiss the sleep from her Eyes. To dry the Tears when she Cries. And Jade is all and Jade is None. And Jade is Moon and she is Sun. And Jade is You and Everyone. And she is Me and and all I've done. And Jade is Lost and she is Won. And Jade is the Bullet shot from your Gun .",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
UB40,Reggae,Food For Thought,Signing Off,1980.0,"Ivory Madonna, dying in the dust. Waiting for the manna coming from the west. Barren is her bosom, empty as her eyes. Death a certain harvest scattered from the skies. Skin and bones is creeping, doesn't know he's dead. Ancient eyes are peeping, from his infant head. Politicians argue sharpening their knives. Drawing up their bargains, trading baby lives. Hear the bells are ringing, Christmas on it's way. Hear the angels singing, what is that they say? Eat and drink rejoicing, joy is hear to stay. Jesus son of Mary is born again today.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

Johnny Cash,Country,Man in Black,Man In Black,,"Well, you wonder why I always dress in black. Why you never see bright colors on my back. And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone. Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on. I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down. Living in the hopeless, hungry side of town. I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime. But is there because he's a victim of the times. I wear the black for those who've never read. Or listened to the words that Jesus said. About the road to happiness through love and charity. Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me. Well, we're doing mighty fine, I do suppose. In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes. But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back. Up front there ought to be a man in black. I wear it for the sick and lonely old. For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold. I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been. Each week we lose a hundred fine young men. And, I wear it for the thousands who have died. Believing that the Lord was on their side. I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died. Believing that we all were on their side. Well, there's things that never will be right I know. And things need changing everywhere you go. But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right. You'll never see me wear a suit of white. Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day. And tell the world that everything's okay. But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back. Until things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black.",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1

With just my arrow and my hickory bow. From a hundred yards don't you know. I do it all the time. They all gather 'round my teepee. Late at night tryin' to catch a peek at me.

Creed,Rock,Faceless Man,Human Clay,1999.0,"I spent a day by the river. It was quiet and the wind stood still. I spent some time with nature. To remind me of all that's real. It's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone. And remember that you feel. I said it's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone. Again I stand, Lord I stand. Against the Faceless Man. Now I saw a face on the water. It looked humble but willing to fight. I saw the will of a warrior. His yoke is easy and his burden is light. He looked me right in the eyes. Direct and concise to remind me. To always do what's right. Again I stand, Lord God I stand. Because if the face inside can't see the light. I know I'll have to walk alone. And if I walk alone to the other side. I know I might not make it home. Next time I see this face. I'll say I choose to live for always. So won't you come inside.

The stench of a love for a younger meat. And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep. The holding up on bended knees. The addiction of duplicities. But I never said I would stay to the end. So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency. Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy. Screaming me over and over and over. I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery.

Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again. Making it up behind my back again. Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again. Holding it up behind my head again. Cut in the deep to the heart of the bone again. Round and round and round and it's coming apart again. Over and over and over. And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces.

Yo, chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that. It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at? Feelin' mad hostile, ran the apostle. Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel. Stroll with the holy roll, then attack the globe with the buckus style. The ruckus, ten times ten men committin' mad sin. Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin. Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums, we'll be. Comin' around the mountain when I come. Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment. My clan increase like black unemployment. Yeah, another one dare, G-Gka-Genius. Take us the fuck outta here. The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels. Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel. Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel. Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table. That's what you get when you misuse what I invent. Your empire falls and you lose every cent. For tryna blow up a scrub. Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb. Should've pumped it when I rocked it. Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets. This goes on in some companies. With majors, they're scared to death to pump these. First of all, who's your A&R? A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar? But he don't know the meanin' of dope. When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap. That's cleaner than a bar of soap. And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight.

Now you can debate, you c-c-c-concentrate. But you can't imitate D.M.C. the Great!. Dissin all devils, causin havoc in HELL. At a very high level base and treble shall YELL. Heard in the heavens are the sounds supreme. So clear to the ear it is sometimes seen. So loud like a cloud with thunder and LIGHTNING. So proud to the crowd it is somewhat FRIGHTENING. No calm in the storm like a beast unleashed. There's no stoppin' 'cause the rockin cannot cease; BREAK!. You see it's harder than hard, not one bit soft. Courageous and contagious so you better break North. Not a cold, on a roll, did you hear me cough? Just listen while I'm dissin cause you're pissin me off. Cold bedding is spreading all across your face. You can't take when I break and if that's the case. I'll go on, and on, and kick the bass. So back up off the cup while I take my taste. It's highly appraised when the hell is raised. So demanding and commanding that you all stand dazed. The unbelieving receiving prophecy so true. I cut the head off the Devil and I throw it at you. My mighty mic control, already brought his soul. The rock king is so bold when he rocks and roll. A black hat is my crown, symbolizin the sound. Signifyin, we won't play around; BUST IT!.

He's in the place with the bass, and style and grace. His name is Jay he's here to play, and win this race. He's off the wall, on the ball, his name is D. Kind of tall yes y'all, he's down with me. From the mountain valley to the deep blue sea. The word is heard as told by D. I don't sing I bring, much delight. Like a star shinin bright in the darkest night. If you are cold, I'll bring you heat. Like I brought the whole world my funky beat. Mysterious and serious I ain't no joke. Fire from the depths of hell AND YOU CAN SMELL THE SMOKE!. Kickin and tickin while you're havin a ball. Like chicken finger lickin I'll be vickin you all. So +Do The Bird, have you heard, did they give you a call. Just me and D.M.C., cold shakin the walls. There's no fearin when hearin sound of this kind. Across the land every man is goin out of his mind. On the face of the earth spreading like disease. Contaminating infiltrating like a horde of bees. Lord of lyrics, duke of discussion. Ruler of rock, and king at cold-crushin. Puller of people - controller of crowds. Lingering lyrics, long-lasting and loud. Left y'all, ah to the left y'all. Because I rock upon the mike real def y'all. And to the right y'all, ah to the right y'all. Because I rock upon the mike all night y'all. You see, I. want respect, if I'm correct. They're all like a ball that I have checked. And the shots they take have no effect. The punk tried to dunk but he broke his neck. Cause I rock harder, and I get farther.

N.W.A,Hip-Hop,Fuck tha Police,Straight Outta Compton,1988.0,"Right about now, N.W.A. court is in full effect. Judge Dre presiding. In the case of N.W.A. versus the Police Department. Prosecuting attorneys are; MC Ren, Ice Cube. And Eazy-motherfucking-E. Order, order, order!. Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth. And nothing but the truth so help your black ass? You goddamn right!. Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say? Fuck the police! Comin' straight from the underground. A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown. And not the other color, so police think. They have the authority to kill a minority. Fuck that shit 'cause I ain't the one. For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun. To be beating on and thrown in jail. We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell. Fuckin' with me 'cause I'm a teenager. With a little bit of gold and a pager. Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product. Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics. You'd rather see me in the pen. Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o. Beat a police out of shape. And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape. To tape off the scene of the slaughter. Still getting swole off bread and water. I don't know if they fags or what. Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts. And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none. But don't let it be a black and a white one. 'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top. Black police showing out for the white cop. Ice Cube will swarm. On any motherfucker in a blue uniform. Just 'cause I'm from the CPT. Punk police are afraid of me. Huh, a young nigga on the warpath. And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath. Of cops, dying in L.A. Yo, Dre, I got something to say. Fuck tha police!. Pull your goddamn ass over right now!. Aww shit, now, what the fuck you pullin' me over for? 'Cause I feel like it!. Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!. Man, fuck this shit!. A'ight, smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!. MC Ren, will you please give your testimony. To the jury about this fucked up incident? And Ren said it with authority. Because the niggas on the street is a majority. A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'. And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in. A stash spot, for the so-called law. Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw. Lights start flashing behind me. But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me. But that shit don't work, I just laugh. Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path. For police, I'm saying, ""Fuck you, punk!"". Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk. Pulling out a silly club, so you stand. With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand. But take off the gun so you can see what's up. And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up!. Make you think I'ma kick your ass. But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast. I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime. But I'ma smoke them now and not next time. Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me. Or any asshole that threatens me. I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope. Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me. The motherfuckin' villain that's mad. With potential to get bad as fuck. So I'ma turn it around. Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound. (Gunshot sounds). Yeah, somethin' like that. But it all depends on the size of the gat. Taking out a police would make my day. But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say. (Knocking sounds). Yeah, man, what you need? Police, open out!. Aww, shit. We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest. Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!. (Move, motherfucker, move now!). What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do? Just shut the fuck up. And get your motherfucking ass on the floor!. (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!). But I didn't do shit. Man, just shut the fuck up!. Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand. And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit? I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'. Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and. Shining the light in my face, and for what? Maybe it's because I kick so much butt. I kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast. On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger. Of an Uzi or an AK. 'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say. They put out my picture with silence. 'Cause my identity by itself causes violence. The E with the criminal behavior. Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor. Without a gun and a badge, what do you got? A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot. By me, or another nigga. And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger. (Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool!). And as you all know, E's here to rule. Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror. And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a. Dumb motherfucker with a gun. And if I'm rollin' off the 8, he'll be the one. That I take out, and then get away. While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say. The verdict:. The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck. White bread, chickenshit motherfucker.

I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard. I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far. Because of you. I never stray too far from the sidewalk. I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt. I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me. Because of you, I am afraid. I lose my way. And it's not too long before you point it out. I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes. I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh everyday of my life. My heart can't possibly break.

But folks just called him yellow. Something always told me. They were reading Tommy wrong. He was only ten years old. When his daddy died in prison. I looked after Tommy. Cause he was my brother's son. I still recall the final words. My brother said to Tommy. Son my life is over, but yours has just begun. Promise me, son. Not to do the things I've done. Walk away from trouble if you can. Now it don't mean you're weak. If you turn the other cheek. And I hope you're old enough to understand. Son, you don't have to fight to be a man. There's someone for everyone. And Tommy's love was Becky. In her arms he didn't have. To prove he was a man. One day while he was working. The Gatlin boys came calling. They took turns at Becky. N'there was three of them. Tommy opened up the door. And saw his Becky crying. The torn dress, the shattered look. Was more than he could stand. He reached above the fireplace. Took down his daddy's picture. As a tear fell on his daddy's face. He heard these words again. The Gatlin boys just laughed at him. When he walked into the barroom. One of them got up. And met him half way cross the floor. Tommy turned around they said. ""Hey look, old yella's leavin'"". But you could've heard a pin drop. When Tommy stopped and locked the door. Twenty years of crawling. Was bottled up inside him. He wasn't holding nothing back. He let 'em have it all. Tommy left the bar room. Not a Gatlin boy was standing. He said, ""This one's for Becky"". As he watched the last one fall. N' I heard him say. I promised you, Dad. Not to do the things you've done. I walk away from trouble when I can. Now please don't think I'm weak. I didn't turn the other cheek. Papa, I sure hope you understand. Sometimes you gotta fight. When you're a man.",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0

Cause my foot will be so far up your ass you'll get hemorrhoids. Before you try to fuck wit Ren. I'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting a size 10. First come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve. Step up and get what you deserve. From the word of a muthafucking hip-hop maniac. Brainiac, so what you oughta do is step the fuck back. Now how the fuck you think a rap will last? Wit your ass saying shit that is said in the past. Yo, be original, your shit is sloppy. Get off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy. Falling deep in the drums so many of styles. Is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles. Cheating and now beating, the crowd I kept seating. But weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating. Styles that kept them full of bull. Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full. They got the nerve to cuss. Only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us. Yo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do. You don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you. You can't harm me, alarm me. Cause we're the generals in this fucking hip-hop army. The niggas wit attitudes if you didn't know. We blow, flow and getting loose slow from the get go, yo. Try us and take it. Yo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in. It's the real thing, you are now real, real niggas, niggas. You can run, but you can't hide, you know I'mma find'cha. Cause a nigga like Ren's only 2 steps behind'cha. Don't look back because you're shaking and all scared. A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare. So sleep wit the lights on, forget that the mic's on. Don't step on my muthafucking stage without nike's on. Don't say it's psycho and then you just might go. Mentally fucked up when I let the right blow. All these niggas wit the jibber jabber. But couldn't kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer. Gangstas in black are out there. But only because, yo, it's the shit that we wear. On my muthafucking dick. But I'mma love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick. So, yo, step off, go to bed, cause if you're mislead. You get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead. Black, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see. A little streetwise nigga, you know me. Rolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps. But you muthafuckas know who run the streets. Wit that hardcore hip-hop rap shit. Now how much harder can another nigga get? Trying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us. Ashes to ashes and dust to dust. So nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please. Since you're on the dick why don't you drop to your knees. Cause I'm a muthafucka that's out to kill. Eazy-E, a nigga that's real. Real niggas, straight off the streets of Compton. Quick to get in your shit without second thought. And if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught. So if you're talking shit about the niggas in black. Bow down to the Kings in Raider hats. They played out, that's what niggas were chanting. One nigga left and they said we ain't happening. People had thought we was finished and then done wit. But if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit. Yet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears. And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas. And when the new record comes, I'll come like a fucking bomb. Asking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb. You're on the dicks of four niggas not one. And when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one. So brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked up. Cause if I let you slide, it's just cause you lucked up. Don't come in my face again, because I'mma floor ya. And if you're a bitch, I'm a fucking ignore ya. Because my attitude's a little bigga. Cause MC Ren is one of the real niggas. Lost in a muthafucking world of madness. Sadness, but Dre is just a nigga that glad there's. Sucka muthafuckas like you, making wack jams. Because it only shows you how dope I am. Never try to ignore us. When I'm expressing, stand still like you're full of rigor mortis. Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure. You can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger. Dre is just a nigga with heart, a nigga that's smart. A nigga that's paid to say what others are scared to play. We started out wit too much cargo. So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold. Yo, N.W.A, criticize for what we say. But I'm a do the shit anyway. Cause I'm the muthafucking doctor, never faking. Yo, Yella, kick the muthafucking break in. N.W.A, straight outta muthafucking Compton. Taking over shit in all of the 1990's. Yo, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, Eazy-E.

I did what I had to do. And saw it through without exception. I planned each charted course. Each careful step along the byway. Oh, and more, much more than this. Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew. When I bit off more than I could chew. But through it all when there was doubt. I ate it up and spit it out. I faced it all and I stood tall. And did it my way. I've loved, I've laughed and cried. I've had my fill, my share of losing. And now as tears subside. I find it all so amusing. To think I did all that. And may I say, not in a shy way. Oh, no, no not me. For what is a man, what has he got. If not himself, then he has not. To say the words he truly feels. And not the words of one who kneels. The record shows I took the blows.",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0
Carrie Underwood,Country,"Jesus, Take the Wheel",Some Hearts,2005.0,"She was driving last Friday on the way to Cincinnati. On a snow white Christmas Eve. Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat. Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline. It'd been a long hard year. She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention. She was going way too fast. Before she knew it, she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass. She saw both their lives flash before her eyes. She didn't even have time to cry. She was so scared. She threw her hands up in the air. Jesus, take the wheel. Take it from my hands. 'Cause I can't do this on my own. I'm letting go. So give me one more chance. Save me from this road I'm on. It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder. And the car came to a stop. She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock. And for the first time in a long time. She bowed her head to pray. She said, ""I'm sorry for the way. I've been living my life. I know I've got to change. So from now on tonight"". Oh, Jesus, take the wheel. Oh, I'm letting go. From this road I'm on. Oh, take it, take it from me. Oh, wow, ooh.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

And on those lonely nights. I could think of them once more. Keep your words alive inside my head. You were the treasure in my hand. You were the one who always stood beside me. So unaware I foolishly believed. That you would always be there. But then there came a day. And I turned my head and you slipped away. It was my last night by your side.

But nothin' silly about the triflin' times of Millie. Millie a Brooklyn Queen originally from Philly. Complete with that accent that made her sound hillbilly. Around this time the slammin' joint was ""Milk is Chillin'"". But even cooler was my social worker Dillon. Yeah I had a social worker 'cuz I had some troubles. Anyone who'd riff on me, I'd pop their dome like bubbles. He'd bring me to his crib to watch my favorite races. That's how his daughter Millie became one of my favorite faces. She had the curves that made you wanna take chances. I mean on her, man, I'd love to make advances. I guess her father must 'a got the same feelin'. I mean, actually findin' his own daughter Millie appealing. At the time no one knew but it was a shame. That Millie became a victim of the touchy-touchy game. Yo Millie, what's the problem, lately you've been buggin'. On your dookie earrings, someone must be tuggin'. You were a dancer who could always be found clubbin'. Now you're world renowned with the frown you're luggin'. Come to think your face look stink when Dill's around you. He's your father-what done happen-did he ground you? You shouldn't flip on him 'cuz Dill is really cool. Matter of fact, the coolest elder in the school. He hooked up a trip to bring us all the Lacey. He volunteered to play old Santa Claus at Macy's. Child, ya got the best pops anyone could have. Dillon's cool, super hip, you should be glad. Yeah, it seemed that Santa's ways were parallel with Dillon. But when Millie and him got home, he was more of a villain. While she slept in he crept inside her bedroom. And he would toss her and then would force her to give him head room. Millie tried real hard to let this hell not happen. But when she'd fuss, he would just commence the slappin'. (Yo Dillon man, Millie's been out of school for a week, man, what's the deal?). I guess he was givin' Millie's bruises time to heal. Of course he told us she was sick and we believed him. And at the department store as Santa we would see 'em. And as he smiled, his own child was at home plottin'. How off the face of this earth she was gonna knock him. When I got home, I found she had tried to call me. My machine had kicked to her hey how ya doin' (sorry). I tried to call the honey but her line was busy. I guess I'll head to Macy's and bug out on Dillon. I received a call from Misses Sick herself.

She claimed I hit the combo dead upon the missile. Wanted to know if I could get a loaded pistol. That ain't a problem but why would Millie need one. She said she wanted her pops Dillon to heed one.

He might breathe a blunt but ya jeans he wouldn't rip. You're just mad he's your overseer at school. No need to play him out like he's someone cruel.

And all the little brats demandin' all of their wishes. Time passes by as I wait for my younger brother. He asks his wish, I waste no time to return him back to Mother. As I'm jettin', Millie floats in like a zombie. I ask her what's her problem, all she says is ""Where is he?"". I give a point, she pulls a pistol, people screamin'. She shouts to Dill, ""He's off to hell cuz he's a demon!"". None of the kids could understand what was the cause. All they could see was a girl holdin' a pistol on Claus. Dillon pleaded mercy, said he didn't mean to. Do all the things that her mind could do nothing but cling to. Millie bucked him and with the quickness it was over.",0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1

I ain't no nigga, fuck that shit. Does everything come out your mouth got to be a 4-letter word? All over this bullshit, it's just a bunch of fuckin' noise. The way you talk about women is bullshit, plain bullshit. What you motherfuckers doin' for the black community anyway?

How can you call yourself a nigga and be proud of it? {*monitor stops beeping - R.I.P.*}. Flatline. Bullshit!. Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me? Well it's because motherfuckers wanna blast me. And run me outta my neighborhood. And label me as a dope dealer yo, and say that I'm no good. But I gave out jobs so niggas wouldn't have to go out. Gave em some dope and a corner so they could show out. When the cops came, they gave a fake name. Because the life in the streets is just a head game. So therefore, to make more. A 15-year-old black kid'll go and rob a liquor store. And get shot in the process. He ate up a nine bullet and now he's put to rest. I guess it's just the way shit has to be. Back when I was young gettin' a job was murder. Fuck flippin' burgers, cause I deserve a. Nine-to-five I can be proud of, that I can speak loud of. And to help a nigga get out of. Yo! The concrete playground. But most motherfuckers only want you to stay down. But I'm a smart motherfucker you see. One of the best producers in the rap music industry. Gettin' paid like a motherfucker. A young brother, who don't give a fuck about another. Yeah. Because police always wanna harass me. Every time that I'm rollin. They swear up and down that the car was stolen. Make me get face down in the street. And throw the shit out my car on the concrete. In front of a residence. A million white motherfuckers on my back like I shot the President. Because my mouth is so motherfuckin' nasty. Bitch this, bitch that, nigga this, nigga that. In the mean while my pockets are gettin' fat. Gettin' paid to say this shit here. Makin' more in a week than a doctor makes in a year. So why not call myself a nigga? It's better than pullin' the trigger and goin' up the river. And then I get called a nigga anyway. Broke as a motherfucker and locked away, so. So cut out all that bullshit.

Because I'm real with this to keep my shit straight bumpin. Murder, created by the streets of Compton. Now get it from the underground poet. I live it, I see it, and I write it because I know it. And if you think I'm fuckin' your wife. You're motherfuckin' right yo, cause I'm a nigga for life. I love niggas, I love niggas, I love niggas. Because niggas are me. And I should only love that which is me. I love that you niggas (""niggas for life""). Nigga this, nigga that. The actual fact is that I'm black and bound to attract.

Except gettin' paid, gettin' bitches, and issuin' stitches. Which is, all needed to read it and find a rhyme. And then it's time to say, the nigga's here to stay.

Slow is the tempo - now talkin' but a nympho. So peep it out here goes the info. This is a bitch that did the whole crew. She get it so much we make bets on who the ho would love to go through. And for the shit that she does, give her a drum roll. Because the dumb bitch licks out the asshole. And she'll let you videotape her.

She took her tongue out her mouth, put it on top. Like a cherry, started movin' it like a snake and it was very irresistable. I couldn't pay the bitch to quit. Cuz the ho' was doin' some ol' crazy shit. That made me start havin' a fit'. Cuz the bitch sucked a hellified dick. Now one night I was at a drive-in. And a car full of niggas straight drove in. I thought they wuz commin' to start trouble but no. Five niggas in the bucket with the neighborhood ho'. Now what do you expect they're gonna dogg her like a doggy. Thirty minutes later and the windowz all were foggy. And I'm off in my car havin' a fit cuz the bitch that I'm with. Said no fuckin' on the first date, shit. And I'm like Damn! I wish I was in the bucket. To be the sixth nigga with the ho' and I can fuck it. So I told the bitch I was with that I'm goin' to the snack bar. And got the fuck out the car. Went to the bucket and I looked through the window. It was some niggas that I knew they let me in yo. And my turn was like next. I couldn't see her face, all I saw was her pussy and her chest. I wanted to see the face, I felt I oughtta. Peep over the seat, Oh shit! It's the preacher's daughter!. And she's only 14 and a ho'. But the bitch sucks dick like a specialized pro. She looked at me, I was surprised. But wasn't passin' up the chance of my dick gettin' baptized. I told the bitch to do it quick. You little ho' hurry up and suck my dick!. Now I'm a break it down with a fact. Since the last ""Just don't bite it"" girls don't know how to act. Sayin' that they never would suck a dick. But when they've tried it they couldn't quit. Cuz ninety percent of the bitches today they love that shit. And those are the main ones that say they don't do it. But MC Ren knows the bitches are used to it. So fellas, next time they try to tell a lie. That they never suck a dick, punch a bitch in the eye. And then the ho' will fall to the ground. Then you'll open up her mouth. Put your dick in and move the shit around. And she'll catch on and start doin' it on her own. Actin' like she's tryin' to suck the meat off a chicken bone. And then she won't let go. Because bitches suck nut out of a dick just like Drano. Get the last drop, unclogging the pipe. Then the stupid bitch is out doing that same shit the next night. Because she just can't quit.

Manuever around the rats and wolves, I'm from the school. Of hard knocks, shots pop, bodies drop. Graveyard, pick a block cause niggas want your spots. I'm trying to stack shit then I go legit. Hollow tip, stuff 'em in a clip case niggas trip. My cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties. I'm supposed to lose, watch me win against the odds. All I got is my word, balls and my instinct. I'm trying to make it, we already made it my friends think. We already on top, I got a bigger plan. No more controlled substances or hand to hand. White collar visions, game changing mission. Big risks, big wins, equal bigger living. Perfect position, watch me transition. From caterpillar to butterfly in the sky.",1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0

See. The less you hear we speak. My brother don't you be like a stubborn sheep. Blessed are he when man shall revile you. And persecute you, say all manner of evil. Against you falsely, for Jah sake.

Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good). And all the niggas in the struggle. You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby. It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine. Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine. Hangin' pictures on my wall. Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl. I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped. Smokin' weed in Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock. Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack. With the hat to match. Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha. You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far. Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight. Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade. Born sinner, the opposite of a winner. Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner. Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri. Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski. I'm blowin' up like you thought I would. Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good. And if you don't know, now you know, nigga. You know very well (Yeah). Who you are (Money, hoes and clothes). Don't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls, yeah, haha). Reach for the stars (It's all good). You had a goal (C'mon). But not that many (It's all good). 'Cause you're the only one. I'll give you good and plenty (Check it). I made the change from a common thief. To up close and personal with Robin Leach. And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day. Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way. The Moet and Alize keep me pissy, girls used to diss me. Now they write letters 'cause they miss me. I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff. I was too used to packing gats and stuff. Now honeys play me close like butter play toast. From the Mississippi down to the East Coast. Condos in Queens, indo for weeks. Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak. Living life without fear. Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear. Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool. Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school. Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood. And it's still all good. You know very well (C'mon). Who you are (Bankrolls). Don't let 'em hold you down (Clothes). Reach for the stars (Mansions). You had a goal. I'll give you good and plenty ('94). Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis. When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this. 50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa. Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur. Phone bill about two G's flat. No need to worry, my accountant handles that. And my whole crew is loungin'. Celebrating every day, no more public housin'. Thinkin' back on my one-room shack. Now my mom pimps an Ac' with minks on her back. And she loves to show me off of course. Smiles every time my face is up in The Source. We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us. No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us. Birthdays was the worst days. Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty. Uh, damn right I like the life I live. 'Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all (It's all good, nigga). You know very well (Money). Who you are (Hoes and clothes). Don't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls). Reach for the stars (That's right). You had a goal (It's all good). But not that many (All good). 'Cause you're the only one (East coast, represent). I'll give you good and plenty (C'mon). Representin' B-Town in the house (Biggie Smalls). Junior Mafia, mad flavor (Bad Boy). Uh, uh, yeah, aight (I see you, Cooch). You know very well. Who you are. Don't let 'em hold you down. Reach for the stars. But not that many. I'll give you good and plenty. Biggie Smalls, it's all good, nigga. Junior Mafia, it's all good, nigga. Bad Boy, it's all good, nigga. It's all good. That's right, '94. And on and on, and on and on. Yeah.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
The Cure,Rock,Lullaby,Disintegration,1989.0,"I spy. Something beginning with 'S'. On candy stripe legs the Spiderman comes. Softly through the shadow of the evening sun. Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead. Looking for the victim shivering in bed. Searching out fear in the gathering gloom. And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room. And there is nothing I can do when I realize with fright. That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight. Quietly he laughs and shaking his head. Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed. And softer than shadow and quicker than flies. His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes. Be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy. Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more. For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light. The Spiderman is having you for dinner tonight. And I feel like I'm being eaten. By a thousand million shivering furry holes. And I know that in the morning. I will wake up in the shivering cold. And the Spiderman is always hungry.

Hank Williams,Country,"Cold, Cold Heart",Memorial Album,1951.0,"I tried so hard, my dear, to show that you're my every dream. Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme. A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart. Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart? Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue. And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do. In anger, unkind words are said that make the teardrops start. You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry. You know you need and want my love, yet you're afraid to try. Why do you run and hide from life, to try it just ain't smart. There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me. But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory. The more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apart.",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1

Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind. And try to take the path less traveled by. That first step you take is the longest stride. (What if, what if?). If today was your last day. And tomorrow was too late. Could you say goodbye to yesterday? Would you live each moment like your last? Leave old pictures in the past? Donate every dime you have? (If today was your last day). Against the grain should be a way of life. What's worth the prize is always worth the fight. Every second counts 'cause there's no second try. So live like you'll never live it twice. Don't take the free ride in your own life. And would you call old friends you never see? Reminisce old memories? Would you forgive your enemies? Would you find that one you're dreamin' of? Swear up and down to God above. That you finally fall in love? (That you finally fall in love). Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart? You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars. Regardless of who you are. So do whatever it takes (Takes). 'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life. Let nothin' stand in your way (Way).

The pile of revenue I create. But I guess I don't get a cut cuz my rent's a month late. Product of a North Carolina cat. Who scratched the back of a pretty woman named Hattie. Who departed life just a little too soon. And didn't see me grab the Plug Tune fame. As we go a little somethin' like this. Look ma, no protection. Now I got a daughter named Ayana Monet. And I can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough. So the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay. I am an early bird but the feathers are black. So the apples that I catch are usually all worms. But it's a must to decipher one's queen. From a worm who plays groupie and spread around the bad germ. I cherish the twilight. I maximize, my soul is the right size. I watch for the power to run out on the moon. (And that'll be sometime soon). Faker than a fist of kids. Speakin that they're black. When they're just niggas trying to be Greek. Or some tongues who lied. And said ""We'll be natives to the end"". Nowadays we don't even speak. I guess we got our own life to live. Or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule? Every now and then I step to the now. For now I see back then I might have acted like a fool. Now I won't apologize for it. This is not a bunch of Bradys. But a bunch of black man's pride. Yet I can safely say. I've never played a sister by touching where her private parts reside. I've always walked the right side of the road. If I wasn't making song I wouldn't be a thug selling drugs. But a man with a plan. And if I was a rug cleaner. Betcha Pos'd have the cleanest rugs I am. The Plug Two brand with the flavour. In the flute watch the sniffin'. So a sack of shows in demand. I read the diction from the second page. I got the one-two gauge. Baritone to the izm fan. Trees fall so I can play ground with my ink. So let me need ya to my ems go. I push the infinite and carry it. My carrier's the three over one. So my pluggins already know. Lick shots with moo. Catch the boo. From a ghost in the heckling crowd. If I give a foot. Jack Ville caught a spill. When a still came from my mouth. I brought a head down south. I don't check for the noose and the neck. So I never tell my ems. That finesse is knocking at my door. I choose to run from the rays of the burning sun. And dodge a needle washing up upon a sandy shore. I bring the element H with the 2. So ya owe me what's coming when I'm raining on your new parade. It's just mind over matter. And what matters is. That the mind isn't guided by the punished shade. I keep the walking on the right side. But I won't judge the next who handles walking on the wrong. Cuz that's how he wants to be. No difference, see. I wanna be like the name of this song I am. The deeds of a natural. Are seeds that are no longer planted. So the famine in the mind is strong. Tactics of another plane is now proven sane. Sane enough to let you know from within this song. I stabilize many cableized viewers. So my occupation's known. But not why I occupy. And that is to bring the peace. Not in the flower but the As-Salaam Alaikum in the third I am.",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

Many times they've come unraveled. On the road both smooth or gravel. But I've made it through, ooh. Hell and half of Georgia. Or walkin' through New Orleans. Walk the streets of Memphis bowlin'. Stroll around a block or two. And if God sees fit to hold me. Anyone that's ever known me. Know I'd walk the gold streets only. In a pair of red shoes. And if I ever get to heaven.

Is grinding slow, but grinding still. Walking home, a youth gets killed. Police free to shoot at will. Nine to five you know the drill. Weekends are a short lived thrill. Cup runneth over till it spill. Take until they've had their fill. Some of us think we're too big. 'Cause the system gives us jobs. Even though it's just a low paying gig. Some of us will boast and brag. And those of us who think we're small. Just because we don't have much. That's really not the case at all. There's riches that the flesh can't touch. Some of us won't respect names. Some of us won't respect loves. Some of us don't respect life. Even though we worship God. And some of us won't let go faith. No matter what the price may cost. Some of us won't practice hate. Because we still believe in love. Working for a dollar bill. Walking home, a child gets killed. Neighbors free to shoot at will. Hurt' to see the old slave mill. Nine to five, we know the drill. Weekends are such a short-lived thrill. Most of us think we're too good. Just because material gain. If we were living as we should. Then less of us would be in pain. Those who are misunderstood. Still deserve a voice to claim. The things that are still meaningful. To each and all of us the same. And some will say the cups are full. And give Jah thanks to what we've gained. And some will say there's much more weight to pull. And them will tell you that straight up and plain. And some will think outside the box. While some of us will hold our lanes. And some of us we write the facts. While some of us a chop down cane. What men won't and what they will. Hurts to see the old slave mill.

Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad. 'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad. Singin' to a man while he played piano. Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel. So Ray J went straight to the radio station. The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"". Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad). Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human. What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman? Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and. I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating. How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating. Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting. For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating. 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated. I make elevating music, you make elevator music. ""Oh, he's too mainstream."". Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it. ""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""'cause I found a hella way to fuse it. With rock, shock rap with Doc. Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it. ""I don't know how to make songs like that. I don't know what words to use."". Let me know when it occurs to you. While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you. It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you. How many verses I gotta murder to. Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!. Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie. But look at the accolades these skills brung me. Full of myself, but still hungry. I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to. And I'm a million leagues above you. Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you. I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel. I'ma sleep in the front seat. Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky"". But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling. Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me. They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate. But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred. I have, then you may be a little patient. And more sympathetic to the situation. And understand the discrimination. But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!. But if I can't batter the women. How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!. Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake. If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation. To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and. Don't be a retardbe a king? Think not. Why be a king when you can be a God?",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Big mama said ""the Devil's up to no good"". But we can heal it on a Sunday with a good book. Or we can kill it on a Monday for a good look. Make it part of the campaign, to withstand pain.

Me against the world, baby. Can you picture my prophecy? Stress in the city, the cops is out for me. The projects is full of bullets. Though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me. Constantly movin' while makin' millions. Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings. Can't reach the children, 'cause they're illin'. Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'. Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted? Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket. The aftermath: more bodies bein' buried. I'm losin' my homies in a hurry, they're relocatin' to the cemetery. Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry. The question is will I live, no one in the world loves me. I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers. Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger. Don't wanna make excuses. 'Cause this is how it is, what's the use? Unless we're shootin', no one notices the youth. Me against the world. 'Cause it's just me against the world, baby. Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself, see. Ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy. Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'. Seein' Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons. Already crazy and screamin', I guess them nightmares as a child. Had me scared but left me prepared for a while. Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw? Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall. Everyday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less. I'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'. Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'. 'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up. My nuts is backed up, I'm about to act up. Go load the MAC up, now watch me klacka. Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'. And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'. So what? Go put some work in and make my mail. Makin' sales, riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well. With nothin' to lose. With all this extra stressin'. The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath. When will I finally get to rest through this oppression? They punish the people that's askin' questions. And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions. The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons. Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions. Be grateful for blessings. Don't ever change, keep your essence. The power is in the people and politics we address. Always do your best, don't let this pressure make you panic. And when you get stranded. And things don't go the way you planned it. Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference. Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen. If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change. It wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world. Got me stuck in the game. Hahaha, that's right. I know it seem hard sometimes. But, uh, remember one thing. Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that. So no matter how hard it get. Stick your chest out, keep your head up, and handle it.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

And you finally found all your courage. To let it all go. Fallen into my arms. Crying for the death of your heart. You were stone white. So delicate. Lost in the cold. You were always so lost in the dark. How you used to be. Slow drowned. You were angels. So much more than everything. Hold for the last time then slip away quietly. Open my eyes. But I never see anything. If only I'd thought of the right words. I could have held on to your heart. I wouldn't be breaking apart. All my pictures of you. Looking so long at these pictures of you.

Pink Floyd,Rock,Dogs,Shine On,1977.0,"You got to be crazy, you gotta have a real need. You gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street. You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed. And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight. You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking. And after a while, you can work on points for style. Like the club tie, and the firm handshake. A certain look in the eye and an easy smile. You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to. So that when they turn their backs on you. You'll get the chance to put the knife in. You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder. You know, it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder. As you get older. Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south. Hide your head in the sand. Just another sad old man. All alone and dying of cancer. And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown. And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone. And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around. So have a good drown, as you go down all alone. Dragged down by the stone. (Stone, stone, stone...). Gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused. Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used. Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise. If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze. Deaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending. That everyone's expendable, and no one has a real friend. And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner. Everything's done under the sun. But you believe at heart everyone's a killer. Who was born in a house full of pain. Who was trained not to spit in the fan. Who was told what to do by the man. Who was broken by trained personnel. Who was fitted with collar and chain. Who was given a pat on the back. Who was breaking away from the pack. Who was only a stranger at home. Who was ground down in the end.

Willie Nelson,Country,Red Headed Stranger,Red Headed Stranger,1975.0,"The red-headed stranger from Blue Rock, Montana. Rode into town one day. And under his knees was a raging black stallion. And walking behind was a bay. The red-headed stranger had eyes like thunder. And his lips, they were sad and tight. His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside. And his heart was heavy as night. Don't cross him, don't boss him. He's wild in his sorrow. He's riding and hiding his pain. Don't fight him, don't spite him. Just wait 'til tomorrow. Maybe he'll ride on again.

But how could she know that this dancing bay pony. Meant more to him than life? For this was the horse that his little lost darling. Had ridden when she was his wife. Just wait till tomorrow. The yellow-haired lady came down to the tavern. And looked up the stranger there. He bought her a drink and he gave her some money. He just didn't seem to care. She followed him out as he saddled his stallion. And laughed as she grabbed at the bay. He shot her so quick, they had no time to warn her. She never heard anyone say.

I was counting on forever, now I'll never know. I can't even breathe. It's like I'm looking from a distance. Standing in the background. Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now. This can't be happening to me. This is just a dream. The preacher man said, ""Let us bow our heads and pray. Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt"". Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard. Then they handed her a folded up flag. And she held on to all she had left of him. Oh, and what could have been.

And meanwhile one man's meal. Is another man's poison. Mankind will do what they must to survive. Innit. Hear me now. In a gunman world. Any night him clock in at work. Marrow splatter, the toolbox pull. The magazine inna the two Glock full. And he's watching as the days go by. And he's counting as his peers all die. Sleeping with the rifle 'cross his chest. So he never gets a good night's rest. And then he's cranky in the morning times. And more victims have to lose their lives. The community a twist and twirl. Wishing that they wasn't in a gunman world. In a gunman life. He might not come home from work one night. So every minute matter. Ignores advice. From his weeping baby mother and child. That he won't win every game he plays. So she know he'll meet his end one day. Some juvenile will have to earn his stripe. And have to take another gunman's life. What if a backstabber names his price. And how ironic if him dead from knife. The 'mount of bullet weh him put 'pon boy. Job description: kill and destroy. Now tell me is it worth it all? If one don rise then a next must fall. Tell me is it worth it all? Those sleepless nights on patrol roll call. One child smile while a next one bawl. Tell me is it worth it? Is it worth it? Is it worth it all? Well in a gunman world. Life is so stressful. Back to school time come. 'cuz when a gunman work. If he is successful. And the job is well done. Then there will be an unsolved crime. With no one to fill out all blank line. John Public haffi hear and deaf. Informer get a kuff, kaff, kweff. Does he get nervous just like you and I? Watching out if the police pass by. 'cuz any day you hear a gunman fail. Then it's either dead house or jail. What will it cost to make a gunman rich? How many lives before a gunman switch? The truth me want the youth them stop ignore. Say the majority of gunman poor, oya oh. If one don rise then a next one fall. And when a gunman makes choice. I wonder what goes through a gunman's mind. And does a gunman think twice? Before him takes another someone's life? I wonder what it is a gunman say. To the Father when a gunman pray. Does he kiss his kids to bed at night? Making sure the blanket tucked just right? Nothing no scary like a gunman voice. When people beg a gunman think twice. And him say no.

J. Cole,Hip-Hop,4 Your Eyez Only,4 Your Eyez Only,2016.0,"Yeah (For your eyes). For your eyes only (For your eyes). For your eyes only, for your eyes only. (For your eyes, for your eyes). For your eyes only. Hey, niggas be dying on the daily. It seems my dreams faded for far too long. The consequences deadly. Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal. Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal. 'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off. Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause. Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black. Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack. And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me. Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet. Like I ain't out in the field like that. I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back. Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless. Screaming, ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless. That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic. To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven. This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic. I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets. But these felonies be making life the hardest. Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet. Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it. That's why I write this sonnet. If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break. Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it. (For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it. (For your eyes) For your eyes only. For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes, do you understand me? You probably grown now so this song'll hit you. If you hearing this, unfortunately means. That I'm no longer with you in the physical. Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive. He got me praying that the spiritual is real. So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too. So I know how part of you feels. Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me. Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me. I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots. And fiends that smoke rocks. I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot. I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance. Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance. Don't know if I ever had a chance. At a glance, I'm a failure. Addicted to pushing paraphernalia. But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once. Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years. My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted. So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging. Blood was staining the concrete. Older niggas I loved talked like they was above. Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money. Picked up the family business by the age of 13. Six years later was handed sentence. 'Round the same time is when you came in this world. Me and your mama thinking:. ""What the fuck we naming this girl?"". I told her ""Nina,"" the prettiest name that I could think of. For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19. Took me two felonies to see the trap. This crooked-ass system set for me. And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be. The one that set examples that was never set for me. I'm living fast, but not fast enough. 'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me. And if my past becomes the death of me. I hope you understand. It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count. Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout? Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated. 'Cause the cash running out? Niggas don't know how to act in a drought. See, baby girl, I realized. My definition of a real nigga was skewed. My views misshaped by new mixtapes. That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true. That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you. They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo. And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food. I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops. Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you. I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views. Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you. Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops. And the cyclical nature of doing time continues. My worst fear is one day that you come home from school. And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news. I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon. And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true. But maybe there's a chance that it's not. And this album remains locked. In a hard drive like valuable jewels. And I can teach you this in person. Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes. I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you. For your eyes, for your eyes only. One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling. What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling. I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing. But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice. And it was chilling, he said:. ""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children. I never asked for nothing, when times was hard. I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me. I dealt with the repercussions of my actions. I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit. But that shit was in my blood, you know my life. I know your momma, nigga, send my love. In case I never get a chance to speak again. I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib. That's the way I wished my family lived. But my granny crib was in the 'jects"". I had to interject like:. ""Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"". He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions. But I been having premonitions. Just call it visions from the other side. I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow. Like the time I'm living on is borrowed. With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father. Write my story down, and if I pass. Go play it for my daughter when she ready"". And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only. Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it. This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son. I dedicate these words to you and all the other children. Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation. That sent your pops to prison when he needed education. Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better. Although I know that means that I would never. Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled. When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro. With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old. Now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told. Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold. Not because he was the first. To get some pussy 12 years old. Not because he used to come through. In the Caddy on some vogues. Not because he went from bagging up. Them grams to serving O's. Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard. Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars. Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law"". Although that was true. Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you.",0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1

Number 2: never let 'em know your next move. Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence? Take it from your highness. I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips. Number 3: never trust nobody. Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up. Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck. She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up. Number 4: I know you heard this before. ""Never get high on your own supply"". Number 5: never sell no crack where you rest at. I don't care if they want a ounce, tell 'em ""bounce!"". Number 6: that goddamn credit? forget it. You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!. 7: this rule is so underrated. Keep your family and business completely separated. Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch. Find yourself in serious shit. Number 8: never keep no weight on you!. Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too. Number 9 shoulda been Number 1 to me:. If you ain't gettin' bagged stay the fuck from police. If niggas think you snitchin' they ain't tryna to listen. They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'. Number 10: a strong word called ""consignment"". Strictly for live men, not for freshmen. If you ain't got the clientele, say ""hell no!"".

Still I left you for months on end. It's been months since I checked back in. We're somewhere in a small town. Somewhere lockin' a mall down. Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down.

So I got to make the song cry. So I got to let the song cry. I can't see it comin' down my eyes. On repeat, the CD of Big's ""Me & My Bitch"". Watchin' Bonnie and Clyde, pretendin' to be that shit.

Made me speed that quick, let me see that's it. It was the cheese, helped them bitches get amnesia quick. I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin' they love me. Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me. Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy. And then they got fuzzy. And they don't remember that, and I don't remember you. Yeah, I've seen 'em comin' down your eyes. But I got to make the song cry. A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone. Word back home is that you had a special friend. So what was oh so special then? You have given away without gettin' at me. That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me? How was I to know that you was plain sick of me? I know the way a nigga livin' was whack. But you don't get a nigga back like that!. Shit, I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that. You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that. You don't throw away what we had, just like that. I was just fuckin' them girls, I was gon' get right back. They say you can't turn a bad girl good. But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever. I'll mourn forever. Shit, I've got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever.

Opening the windows and breathing in petrol. An amateur band rehearsing in a nearby yard. Watching the telly and thinking 'bout your holidays. Waking up from bad dreams and smoking cigarettes. Cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume. A hot summer's day and sticky black tarmac. Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were far away. Two lovers kissing masks a scream of midnight.

No boats, no snowmobiles and no skis. Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford. To provide my family with groceries. Got a crib with a studio. And it's all full of tracks. To add to the wall full of plaques. Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies. Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze? Ho, please!. You better bow down on both knees. Who you think taught you to smoke trees? Who you think brought you the oldies? Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s. The Snoop D-O-double-G's. And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police!"". Gave you a tape full of dope beats. To bump when you stroll through in your hood. And when your album sales weren't doin' too good. Who's the Doctor they told you to go see? Y'all better listen up closely. All you niggas that said that I turned pop. Or The Firm flopped. Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep. So fuck y'all, all of y'all!. If y'all don't like me, blow me!. Y'all are gon' keep fuckin' around with me. And turn me back to the old me. Nowadays, everybody wanna talk. Like they got somethin' to say. But nothin' comes out when they move their lips. Just a bunch of gibberish. And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre. So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?). Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way? Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup). Just study a tape of N.W.A. One day I was walkin' by. With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy. Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?). And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani. I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not. I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge. When I'm drunk as fuck. Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage. Hoppin' out with two broken legs. Tryna walk it off. Fuck you too, bitch! Call the cops!. I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs. And when the cops came through. Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house. With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches. And still weren't found out (Right here!). So from here on out, it's the Chronic II. Startin' today and tomorrow's anew. And I'm still loco enough. To choke you to death with a Charleston Chew. Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady. Hotter than a set of twin babies. In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up. When the temp goes up to the mid-80s. Callin' men ladies. Sorry Doc, but I been crazy. There's no way that you can save me. It's okay, go with him, Hailie (Dada?). But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch of gibberish. If it was up to me, you motherfuckers'd stop. Comin' up to me with your hands out. Lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free. When my last CD was out, you weren't bumpin' me. But now that I got this little company. Everybody wanna come to me. Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me. 'Cause I'm from the streets of C-Compton! (Compton!). I told 'em all. All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all? Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none. What, you think I sold 'em all. 'Cause I stay well off? Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off. What, 'cause I been in the lab. With a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off? I ain't havin' that. This is the millennium of Aftermath. It ain't gon' be nothin' after that. So give me one more platinum plaque. And fuck rap, you can have it back. So where's all the Mad Rappers at?

John Denver,Country,Casey’s Last Ride,Aerie,,"Casey joins the hallow sound of silent people walking down. The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below. Following their footsteps through the neon darkened corridors. Of silent desperation never speaking to a soul. The poison air he's breathing has a dirty smell of dying. Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain. But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes. Of the clicking of the turnstyle and the rattle of his chain. Oh she said, Casey it's been so long since I've seen you. Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile. See she said, I put on new stockings just to please you. Lord she said, Casey can you only stay a while. Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the Golden Crown. For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones. Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men. Who reach for anything thay can to keep from going home. Standing in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter. Never glancing in the mirror at the people passin' by. And he stumbles as he's leavin' and he wonders if the reason. Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye. Oh she said, I suppose you seldom think about me. Now she said, now that you've a family of your own. Still she said, it's so blessed good to feel your body.

All it takes is one song on the radio, you're. Right back on it, reminding me all over again. How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt. Spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search. Maybe I needed to grow up a little first. Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt. But I'm coming for closure. Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed, for. The way that you turned your back on me. Just when I may have needed you most. Oh, you thought it was over? You could just close the. Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing? You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine. Well, I've never recovered. But tonight I bet you that what you're. 'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered. Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice. Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, ""Let it go, fuck this."". Heart's saying, ""I will, once I bury this bitch alive. Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset."". I flee the scene like it was my last ride. You see right through. Oh, you had me pegged the first time. You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify. What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy. I just hate to be the bad guy. (Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un). And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch. To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit. Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it? Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch!. Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit. Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!. You left our family in shambles. And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed? May be gone but he's not forgotten. And don't think 'cause he's been out the pictures. So long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to get ya. You're wrong and that shit was rotten. And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, cold. Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through? Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to? Not once you call to ask me how I'm doin'. Letters, you don't respond to 'em. Fuck it, I'm coming to see you. And, gee, who better to talk to than you? The cause of my problems. My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on you. Poof, then I'm gone, voosh. I've been drivin' around your side of this town. Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now. Finally I found your new address, park in your drive. Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life. And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva. My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house. See, it's sad it came to this point. Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment. To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy. I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy. It's revenge that I seek. So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window. Like I reached my full potential: I peeked. Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep. Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak. All the way 'round to the back porch. Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this. You don't plan for intruders beforehand? Surprised to see me? Cat caught your tongue? Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung. Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan. Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans. Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk? And here's your Bronco hat. You can have that shit back 'cause they suck. It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it. We're in the car right now wait, here comes my favorite lyric. ""I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"". And hey, here's a sequel to my. Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy. How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun!. Last album now, 'cause after this you'll be officially done. Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell. Bitch, I even have your initials. I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it. Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck. The best place you could be buried alive is right here. Two more exits, time is quite near. Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear. That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea, as cops appear in my driver's side mirror. (Oh, God! Police! Aaaghh!). Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least. New plan, Stan!. Slim: ""Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"". Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge. Ha ha, big bro, it's for you; Slim, this is for him. And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good. Now say you hate homos again!. Part 2: Produced by StreetRunner. I also represent. Anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend. I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in.

When they say all of this is approachin' its end. But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again. Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds. Toilets clogged, yeah, 'cause I'm talking a lot of. Shit but I'm backing it all up. But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers. After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience. I'm the ringing in your ears. I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils. Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts. I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged. Grab for some water. But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow. I'm the bullies you hate that you became. With every faggot you slaughtered. Coming back on you, every woman you insult. Batter, but the double-standards you have. When it comes to your daughters. I represent everything you take for granted. 'Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona. Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic. Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone. 'Cause after all the glitz and the glam. No more fans that are calling your name. Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them. I'm the hindsight to say, ""I told you so!"". Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow. I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow. If you don't stop after they call ya. Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits. When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip. The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions. If there's anything you have left to say. 'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother. So 'fore you rest your case. Better make sure you're packin' a wallop. So, one last time, I'm back. Before it fades into black and it's all over. Behold the final chapter in a saga. Tryin' to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle. Twice, the magic that started. It all, tragic portrait of an artist. Tortured, trapped in his own drawings. Tap into thoughts blacker and darker. Than anything imaginable; here goes a wild stab in the dark. As we pick up where the last Mathers left off.",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1
De La Soul,Hip-Hop,The Magic Number,3 Feet High and Rising,1989.0,"Three, that's the Magic Number. Yes, it is, it's the magic number. Somewhere in this hip-hop soul community. Was born three: Mase, Dove and me. And that's the magic number. (What does it all mean?). Difficult preaching is Posdnuos' pleasure. Pleasure and preaching starts in the heart. Something that stimulates the music in my measure. Measure in my music, raised in three parts. Casually see but don't do like the Soul. Cause seein' and doin' are actions for monkeys. Doin' hip hop hustle, no rock and roll. Unless your name's Brewster, cause Brewster's a Punk (three). Parents let go cause there's magic in the air. Criticising rap shows you're out of order. Stop look and listen to the phrase Fred Astaires. And don't get offended while Mase do-si-do's your daughter. A tri-camera rolls since our music's now set. Fly rhymes are stored on a Da.I.S.Y. production. It stands for ""Da Inner Sound, Y'all"" and y'all can bet. That the action's not a trick, but showing the function. Everybody wants to be a deejay. Everybody wants to be an emcee. But being speakers are the best. And you don't have to guess. De La Soul posse consists of three. This here piece of the pie. Is not dessert, but the course that we dine. And three out of every darn time. The effect is ""Mmmm"" when a daisy grows in your mind. Showing true position, this here piece is. Kissin' the part of the pie that's missin'. When that negative number fills up the cavity. Maybe you can subtract it. You can call it your lucky partner. Maybe you can call it your adjective. But odd as it may be. Without my 1 and 2 where would there be. My three: Mase, Pos and me. And that's the Magic Number. Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul. Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds. Common are speakers who honor the scroll. Scrolls written daily creates a new sound. Listeners listen cause this here is wisdom. Wisdom of a Speaker, a Dove and a Plug. Set aside a legal substance to feed 'em. For now get 'em high off this dialect drug. Time is a factor so it's time that counts. Count not the negative actions of one. Speakers of soul say it's time to shout. Three forms the soul to a positive sum. Dance to this fix and flex every muscle. Space can be filled if you rise like my lumber. Advance to the tune but don't do the hustle. Shake, rattle, roll to my Magic Number. Now you may try to subtract it. But it just won't go away. Three times one? (What is it?). (One, two, three!). And that's a Magic Number. (Yo, what's up?). (1, 2, 3). (I say, children, what does it all mean?). (Woah-woah-wo, 1, 2, 3). (I wouldn't lie to you). (No more no less, that's a magic number). (No more no less). (What it is?). (Do the shang-a-lang). (Anybody in the audience ever get hit by a car?).

We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us. We even talked about you and our couple of moments. He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups. You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone. Looking like you came from the 70's on your own. My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is. Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone? You don't even know what you want from love anymore. I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored. But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh? Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures. Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage. When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit. A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it. 'Cause that night I played her three songs. Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on. Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz. Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off. Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria. Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria. Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music. When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it. The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree. I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me. Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment? Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't. Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz. Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision. Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions. When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven. It seem like you don't want this love anymore. I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore. ""Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G. Been a East Side ting. Scarborough ting from time, G. Been have up di ting dem from time, G. So I don't know what's wrong with these. Little wasteman out here eh? Y'all need to know yourself. "".",0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1
Eminem,Hip-Hop,Lucky You,Kamikaze,2018.0,"Whoa, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it. I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it. All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it. I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it). Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules. I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose. Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food. Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you. Fuck you too, woo!. Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move. Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice. Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot. Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice. Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall. Turn my back on you, all of you finished. Back to these bullets, it's back to the job. Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'. Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'. These packs and I'm actually pumpin'. Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'. You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'. I'm actually buzzin' this time. Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine. I do not fuck with you guys. If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time. I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers. Some chains and some blades and a couple of nines. Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree. My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I). Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo). They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo). I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo). Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah). You play your cards, I reverse on you all. And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup). Callate boca mejor, maricon, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner). They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old. Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now. Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down. In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down. I've been alone and I never needed nobody. Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down. Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle. I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now. I said ain't no love for the other side. Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner). When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah). You in the wrong cab down the wrong path. Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo). Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast. I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!). I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it. This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it. I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em. Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition. Fuck's the difference? I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules. Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose. I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full. I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me. Fuck you think? (Woo!). I got a couple of mansions. Still I don't have any manners. You got a couple of ghost writers. But to these kids it don't actually matter. They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"". I said, ""I don't have any answers."". 'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album. It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers. And actually comin' from humble beginnings. I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning. I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!"". ""We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"". But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability. To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me. The inability to pen humility. Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of. Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em? Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular. Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up. Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck. About the ones that were here before you that made rap. Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks. ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at? We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back. 'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage. All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap. I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad. But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat. That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that. But I think it's inevitable. They know what button to press or what lever to pull. To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch). And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger. But you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?). On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'. Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits. I'm asleep at the wheel again. As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent. Of another beat I'ma kill again. 'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again. Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin. It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram. And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again. Levels to this shit, I got an elevator. You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker. I sound like a broken record every time I break a record. Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater. Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way. I got spite inside my DNA. But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy. It's the moment y'all been waitin' for. Like California wishin' rain to pour. In that drought, y'all been prayin' for. My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw. Still the same Marshall, that outlaw. That they say as a writer might've fell off. I'm back on that bull like the cowboy. So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move.",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

Hangin' way too fuckin' close, beware the barrier. This is Hub City, nigga, don't make us embarrass you. Man, you should be realistic, these niggas 'round here ballistic. We did the numbers and you lookin' like another statistic. Ahh, shit! Recognize what lives inside these eyes. I'ma ride until the dead has risen. Live in a project building, dodgin' the module ceilings. I ride, I'ma ride in a stolen Jeep. Ride with the eyes of five blind men, my vision (Corrupted). Mama tried counselin', five plans for Kendrick (But fuck it). My family's ties, had sabotaged Rosecrans existence (Abducted). My aliens on surveillance, they paid me a visit (Disgusting). Our stadium's packed, Raiders in black. Curls drippin', silver bullet, palladium in my strap. I lie on the side of a one way street. Nowhere to go, death all I can see. I say ""Fuck is up?

And immune to nearly any weapon. When it's properly used it's almost invincible. Raw I'ma give it to ya, with no trivia. Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia. My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation. Like the Emancipation Proclamation. Weak MCs approach with slang that's dead. You might as well run into the wall and bang your head. I'm pushin' force, my force you're doubtin'. I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains. Well, I'm a sire, I set the microphone on fire. Rap styles vary and carry like Mariah. I come from the Shaolin slum, and the isle I'm from. Is comin' through with nuff niggas and nuff guns. So if you wanna come sweatin', stressin', contestin'. You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection. Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk. Phony niggas are outlined in chalk. I'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made me. Rebel to the grain, there's no way to barricade me. Steamrollin' niggas like an 18 wheeler. With a drunk driver drivin', there's no survivin'. Rough like Timberland wear, yeah. Me and the Clan in 'Yota Landcruisers out there. Peace to all the crooks, all the niggas with bad looks. Bald heads, braids, blow this hook. We pack chrome TEC's, nickel-plated MAC's. Black AC's, drug-dealin' styles in phat stacks. I only been a good nigga for a minute though. 'Cause I got to get my props and win it, yo. I got beef with commercial-ass niggas with gold teeth.

Tryin' to be a hip-hop MC. The law, in order to enter the Wu-Tang. You must bring the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang. Represent the GZA, Abbot. RZA, Shaquan, Inspectah Deck. Dirty Ho gettin' low with his flow. Introducin' the Ghostface Killah. No one could get iller. In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack. Speakin' of the Devil, psych!. No, it's the God, get the shit right. Mega trife, and yo, I killed you in a past life. On the mic while you was kickin' that fast shit. You reneged, tried again and got blasted. Half-mastered-ass style, mad ruff task. When I struck I had on Timbs and a black mask. Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack. That night, yo, I was hittin' like a spiked bat. And then you thought I was bugged out, and crazy. Strapped for nonsense, after me became lazy. Yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs. Never shot thugs, I'm runnin' with thugs that flood mugs. So, grab your eight plus one. Start flippin' and trippin', niggas is jettin', I'm lickin' off, son. Wu! Tang! Tang!. Ta-a-ang!. Homicide's illegal and death is the penalty. What justifies the homicide, when he dies in his own iniquity? It's the master of the Mantis Rapture comin' at ya. We have an APB on an MC Killer. Looks like the work of a master. Evidence indicates that his stature. Merciless like a terrorist hard to capture. The flow changes like a chameleon. Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger. This technique attacks the immune system. Disguised like a lie, paralyzin' the victim. You scream as it enters your bloodstream. Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain.

Hold a heart so tight it shatters. So I stay away from things that break. Can't make a man a promise. With the best of intentions. Drive two hundred miles on a rundown engine. Put a blanket underneath a hollow tree. When the wind blows hard it will fall on me. Stick around long enough and you will see. Me, I don't ever wanna get too close. Or be held responsible.

Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something. If all it's gonna cause is pain. Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain. So let the river run. He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack. Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched. On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict. And she just wants to exact revenge and get back. It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack. She's kept track of all his Internet chats. And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next. Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks. 'Cause she loves danger, psychopath. And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that. But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back. Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand. So she's been on the web lately. Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man. And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care. Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne"". After the first night, but tonight I am. The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain. A one-night stand turned a two-night stand. It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and. He found out, now she feels deserted and used. 'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too. Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through? It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue. Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth. Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you. So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners. Don't have to be reserved in a booth. I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's. Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew. And now that I got you I don't want you. Took advantage in my thirst to pursue. Why do I do this dirt that I do? Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech. Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound. 'Cause now with her in the womb. We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew. To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit. Fuck!. My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh). River (ooh), river run. Call me (ooh), call me (ooh). River (ooh), we'll let the river run. Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!"". Fuck can I say? If life was a highway. And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes. Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe. That's why I may have came at you sideways. I can't keep my lies straight. But I made you terminate my baby. This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled. What else can I say? It was fun for a while. Bet I really woulda loved your smile. Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it. What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child? Well, little one (I'm sorry). I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up).",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1

I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her. We put on a shine, put on a motor. Built out of love, and made for the water. Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten. A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten. It was just an old plywood boat. With a '75 Johnson and electric choke. A young boy, two hands on the wheel. I can't replace the way it made me feel. And I would turn her sharp. And I would make it whine. He'd say, ""You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides"". Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line. But I was king of the ocean. When Daddy let me drive. Just an old half ton short bed Ford. My Uncle bought new in '64. Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking. A couple of burnt valves and he had it going. He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load. Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road. I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals. Smiling like a hero that just received his medal. It was just an old hand me down Ford. With three speed on the column and a dent in the door. I can't replace the way it made me feel and. I would press that clutch. And I'd keep it right. He'd say ""A little slower son, you're doing just fine"". Just a dirt road with trash on each side. But I was Mario Andretti. I'm grown up now, three daughters of my own. I let them drive my old Jeep. Across the pasture at our home. Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file. And pull out that old memory. And think of me and smile and say. It was just an old worn out Jeep. With rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet. A young girl, two hands on the wheel. And he'd say ""Turn it left"" and ""Steer it right"". Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine. Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride. But I was high on a mountain.

And I just hit town and my throat was dry. I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew. At an old saloon on a street of mud. There at a table, dealing stud. Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue."". Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad. From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had. And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye. He was big and bent and gray and old. And I looked at him and my blood ran cold. And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!. Now you're going to die!!"". Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes. And he went down, but to my surprise. He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear. But I busted a chair right across his teeth.

Some are born and some are dying. It's alpha and omega's kingdom come. And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree. The virgins are all trimming their wicks. The whirlwind is in the thorn tree. It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks. Till Armageddon no salam, no shalom. Then the father hen will call his chickens home. The wise man will bow down before the throne. And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns. Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still. Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still. Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still. Listen to the words long written down. Hear the trumpets hear the pipers. In measured hundred weight and penny pound. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts.

(Ey, homie, what happened). My whole life flashed before my eyes, man. Life. Niggas used to come and get me. When it was time to disagree with an enemy. Pass the Hennessy it gives me energy. Packed the gat in the small of my back. Where these niggas at, I'll clear the whole pack. Talking shit cause I'm down for my set. I'm a vet, smoking on a wet cigarette. Who these niggas think they are. Wishing on a ghetto star, I represent my tar. I start busting and they scatter like water bugs. Cause these Westside niggas is harder thugs. Enslave us but nothing can save us from sporting Ben Davis. Shootin' at your neighbors. Cause sometimes I feel like a nut. Don't give a fuck when I open you up. Hot rocks. Fly from the back seat. And busta-ass niggas run like a track meet. And if you caught in the middle. Bleed more than a little (what). Killer King is the hospital. Feeling numb from the bullets I hum. And when they hit. Black mothers have fits. I don't give a shit. Fool I'm a vet you can bet. That I could dance underwater and not get wet. Check it. It's raining bullets and I'm still there. I'm still there. My house shoes get wet from the dew on the grass. Up early in the morning taking out the trash. Feeling like a loser, alcohol abuser. Two youngsters roll up on a beach cruiser. One on the peddles, the other on the handle bars. Tryna be ghetto stars. They said, ""are you from the Westside is it so?"". I said, ""hell yeah and who want to know?"". Me. In slow mo', .44 slugs, face down in the mud. Puddle full of blood. Left for dead, the pain starts to spread. Now I can't feel my legs. I meet Doctor Who at King Drew medical center. As I enter I.C.U. He said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital. I said I can't move my legs, he said don't try to. Now this ain't the end my friend but you'll probably never walk again. I sit there motionless holding this pain inside contemplating suicide. At night I jerk and jerk. But my dick don't work it don't even hurt. Now who'd ever thought a nigga rude as Ice Cube. A'be pissing through a tube. Fool I'm a vet. Fool, I'm a vet you can bet. I can dance underwater and not get wet (check it). Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair. Fuck a V-A they need G-A. Gang Hospital for a cripple. Now I'm drinking Ripple. Same corner, same hood I'm still there. With bandanas tied to my wheel chair. To all the hood rat hoes I'm fired. They mad cause my tongue get tired. Now everybody want to put they dope on me. Sayin I won't get searched by the LAPD. I'm sittin' in a doorway deuce-five. Depending on that to keep my ass alive. I don't got bows but my arm's about a one-six. With fucking legs looking like tooth picks. Some times I can't deal. Got to beg the BG's to roll me up the hill. Put me on the porch. Now I'm on the torch. Smoking cocaine. Just to maintain. Nothing to gain nothing to lose. And last night I couldn't make it to the bathroom. Feeling like a 2-year-old. You can't get a sip from the brew I hold. It's the only friend to a stranger. AKA: handicapped gangbanger. There's a lot in my life I regret becoming a ghetto vet. Fool I'm a Vet. Dedicated to all the ghetto vets. For every nigga that done took one for the hood.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Garth Brooks,Country,The Thunder Rolls,No Fences,1990.0,"Three thirty in the mornin', not a soul in sight. The city's lookin' like a ghost town on a moonless summer night. Raindrops on the windshield, there's a storm movin' in. He's headin' back from somewhere that he never should have been. And the thunder rolls. Every light is burnin' in a house across town. She's pacin' by the telephone in her faded flannel gown. Askin' for a miracle, hopin' she's not right. Prayin' it's the weather that's kept him out all night. The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes. Another love grows cold on a sleepless night. As the storm blows on out of control. Deep in her heart the thunder rolls. She's waitin' by the window when he pulls into the drive. She rushes out to hold him, thankful he's alive. But on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows. And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes, and he knows that she knows. She runs back down the hallway, and through the bedroom door. She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer. Tells the lady in the mirror, ""He won't do this again"". 'Cause tonight will be the last time she'll wonder where he's been.",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1

I can feel the changes. I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous. I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless. You don't know what pain is. How can I paint this picture. When the color blind is hangin' with you? Fell on my face and awoke with a scar. Another mistake livin' deep in my heart. Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick.

Old songs leave long shadows. Makes you shut down all your emotions. Money needs money, and slums need the poor. Curled like an animal lying on the floor. So long my fatal friend. I don't need this. The sky's so clear, that different view. I rarely dream unless it's true. Confusion or master plan. Deceived by the rest, you still have to run. The roads never end, the motion starts.

Creeping up the stairs in the dark. Waiting for the death blow. Stroking your hair as the patriots are shot. Fighting for freedom on television. Sharing the world with slaughtered pigs. Have we got everything?,. She struggles to get away. The pain and the creeping feeling, a little black haired girl. Waiting for Saturday, the death of her father pushing her. Pushing her white face into the mirror. Aching inside me and turn me 'round. Just like the old days. Caressing an old man and painting a lifeless face. Just a piece of new meat in a clean room. The soldiers close in under a yellow moon. All shadows and deliverance under a black flag. A hundred years of blood, crimson. The ribbon tightens round my throat.

"", ""How you know somethin' missin'?"". He scratch his head, she say, ""Get back in bed"". And she gave him some head. Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she sayooh. Then when they leave they get followed. I be with bitches that know the bitches. That's with the niggas we followin'. Get them on the line, stay two cars behind. And tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious!"". Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care. She handle the business and don't ever tell. She bite the bullet and cough up the shells. She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place!"". And if he say yeah, then we meet him there. She feed him lies with his silverware. She don't want love, she just want her share. I know a bitch named Liz. This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is. So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears. And then she tell me and I be all ears. And then I go and tell my people and they already know him. And then I call Liz and she say he comin' over. I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told ya"". She gave me the salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier"". We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up. Walk up to the door and right before he knock. She open the door naked, she left it unlocked. They started French kissin' so he didn't see moi. And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch. Music up loud with his head in the clouds. Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him. Piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown. Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around. I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down. You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up. Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down. And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her. She a good actress and you a dead actor. You'll be dead after we get what we're after. If Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh. I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga. But think for me, nigga. Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga. I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga. She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga. She slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga.

We just lookin' for the casserole, nigga. But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (uh). Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup. And a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall. Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter. Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball. Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh. Probably on a Internet blog. In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother. Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow. Mona Lisa. Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls. And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it. Make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God. Poetry in a pear tree. Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him. Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi. Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat. Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby. Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie. I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing. I'ma call up again like I did last week. Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy. Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley. Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy. Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me. Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me. 'Bout a motherfuckin' double standard, acting. Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone. But you sucked this dick, that's just nasty. Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!). You fuckin' with Wayne's? Bitch, gimme your phone! Let me, let me take this call real quick. ( lick me like a lollipop) He on your fuckin' ringtone? Is that the shit that you do? Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos. Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews. I don't know what the fuck lately got into you. Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder. Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter? The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma. Daycare after school and she never did charge ya. You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up. You know what, I give up, let me go get my gun. I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin'. Goddammit, you know that the damage is done. Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress. I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess. So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy. I'm killin' myself. She say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa. Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa.

2Pac,Hip-Hop,Keep Ya Head Up,Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...,1993.0,"Little something for my godson Elijah. And a little girl named Corin. Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice. I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots. I give a holla to my sisters on welfare. 2Pac cares if don't nobody else care. And I know they like to beat you down a lot. When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot. But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up. Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up. And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him. And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him. 'Cause, sister, you don't need him. And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em. You know what makes me unhappy? When brothers make babies. And leave a young mother to be a pappy. And since we all came from a woman. Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman. I wonder why we take from our women. Why we rape our women do we hate our women? I think it's time to kill for our women. Time to heal our women, be real to our women. And if we don't we'll have a race of babies. That will hate the ladies that make the babies. And since a man can't make one. He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one. So will the real men get up? I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up. Keep ya head up, ooh, child. Things are gonna get easier. Things'll get brighter. Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me. He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be. And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough. And though we had it rough, we always had enough. I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules. Ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two. And I realize Mama really paid the price. She nearly gave her life to raise me right. And all I had to give her was my pipe dream. Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen. I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents. It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent. And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen. I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind. Last night my buddy lost his whole family. It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity. It seems the rain'll never let up. I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up. You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours. They got money for wars but can't feed the poor. Say there ain't no hope for the youth. And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future. And then they wonder why we crazy. I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby. We ain't meant to survive, 'cause it's a set-up. And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up. And uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own. I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone. Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome. Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em. 'Cause I think we can make it; in fact, I'm sure. And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more. 'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son. Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'. You can't complain you was dealt this. Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless. Because there's too many things for you to deal with. Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless. While tears is rollin' down your cheeks. You steady hopin' things don't fall down this week. 'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it. And don't blame me I was given this world, I didn't make it. And now my son's gettin' older and older. And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders.

Please God walk with me. Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven. Back in elementary, I thrived on misery. Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed. Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest. Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest. Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past. You wanna last? Be the first to blast. Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased. Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets. Now he rest in peace. Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me. So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears. I suffered through the years. And shed so many tears. Lord, I lost so many peers. Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means. Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen. And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed. I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse. God, can you feel me? Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain. Show me some happiness again. I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well. I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail? My life is in denial and when I die. Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears. Lord, I suffered through the years. Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears. I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me. My every move is a calculated step. To bring me closer to embrace an early death. Now there's nothin' left. There was no mercy on the streets. I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin'. About to go to pieces, screamin' peace. And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it. I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free. They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame. Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game. No memories, just a misery. Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep. Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun? Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come. Lord! (God!). God, I lost so many peers. And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide. Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die. Wonder why as I walk by. Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high. This ain't the life for me, I wanna change. But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game. I'm trapped inside a maze. See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy. Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies. So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady. Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison. I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys. Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor.

Kenny Rogers,Country,The Gambler,The Gambler,1978.0,"On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere. I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep. So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness. 'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak. He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces. And knowin' what their cards were. By the way they held their eyes. So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces. For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice"". So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow. Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light. And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression. Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy. You gotta learn to play it right"". You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em. Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done. Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'. Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep. 'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser. And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep. And when he finished speakin'. He turned back towards the window. Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep. And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even. But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep. You got to know when to hold 'em (When to hold 'em). Know when to fold 'em (When to fold 'em).",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

I love payin' rent when the rent is due. I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you. 'Cause when I was low you was there for me. And never left me alone, because you cared for me. And I could see you comin' home after work late. You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate. You just workin' with the scraps you was given. And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'.

'Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama. And when it seems that I'm hopeless. You say the words that can get me back in focus. When I was sick as a little kid. To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did. And all my childhood memories. Are full of all the sweet things you did for me. And even though I act crazy. I gotta thank the Lord that you made me. There are no words that can express how I feel. You never kept a secret, always stayed real. And I appreciate how you raised me. And all the extra love that you gave me. I wish I could take the pain away. If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day. Everything will be alright if you hold on.

I bring death to a snake when he least expect. Ain't a damn thing changed, boy, Protect Ya Neck. Ruler Zig Zag, Zig-Allah jam is fatal. Quick to stick my Wu-Tang sword right through ya navel. Suspenseful, plus bein bought through my utensil. The pencil, I break strong winds up against your. Abbot, that run up through your county like the Maverick. Caps through the tablets, I gots to make the fabrics. Are uh-ah-uh Are you a warrior? Killer? Slicin shit like a samurai. The Ol' Dirty Bastard from the bar. Ol' Dirty clan of terrorists. Comin atcha ass like a sorceress, shootin' that PISS!. Niggas be gettin on my fuckin nerves. Rhymes they be kickin make me wanna kick they fuckin ass to the curb. I got funky fresh, like the old specialist. A carrier, messenger, bury ya. This experience is for the whole experience. Let it be applied, and THEN DROP THAT SCIENCE. My my my. My Clan is thick like plaster. Bust ya, slash ya. Slit a nigga back like a Dutch Master Killer. Style jumped off and Killa, Hill-er. I was the thriller in the Ali-Frazier Manilla. I came down with phat tracks that combine and interlock. Like getting smashed by a cinder block. Blaow! Now it's all over. Niggas seeing pink hearts, yellow moons.

Nickelback,Rock,After the Rain,Feed the Machine,2017.0,"All your life, scramble and scurry. Take your time, rather than hurry. Never too late to write the best of your story. Remember to breathe or else you're gonna be sorry. Life's no race, it's a companion. Always face with reckless abandon. The ticket to life as my mother once told me. Stick with your pride and you're gonna be lonely (gonna be lonely). Everybody says that life takes patience. But nobody wants to wait. Everybody says we need salvation. But nobody wants to be saved. The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train. The blue skies we wait on. Are gonna have to come after the rain. Spend your days happy and grateful. Avoid the taste of wanting and wasteful. Every good thing will come in moderation. Envy and greed will only lead to frustration. Choose your friends, carefree and kindly. Choose your words, careful and wisely. Always be there to lend a comforting shoulder. One will be there to share a day when you're older (a day when you're older). All mistakes, committed upon us. Always take a toll on the conscience. Every regret is a debt that you live with. Never forget to remember forgiveness. Are gonna have to come after the rain (ra-ai-ai-ain). Gonna have to come after the rain (ra-ai-ai-ain). Rain, yeah. Ra-ai-ai-ain. Gonna have to come after the rain.",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
De La Soul,Hip-Hop,Drawn,and the Anonymous Nobody,2016.0,"Shadow you're drawn, why don't you go? In the corner babe watching the snow. Moving afar, rolling away. In the corner, believe, why won't you stay? Won't you stay babe? Oh, I never know what come around. I never looked ahead. I'm wreckin' rules and it's pulling us down. The words I wished I'd said. Shadow you're drawn and you got your ways. Shadow you're painted red, red. It's drawn, it's drawn. One, two. Yo, I'm what the paper plate couldn't hold. Too many dreams, a paperweight took a toll. Food on the floor, not to be wasted. Or doing what's being pasted and know that it's not a copy. Eye on the prize, instead of gas prices. Lyrically wonder why I travel past the nicest. Born of a generation that don't generate patience. And travel too fast for you to clock me. Not always a good thing. You can lose the love of your life to a lifetime of love on tour. I didn't mean to be a whore but my hormones. Had me like a fiend screamin' ""What you got for me?"". Two words (I'm mortal). But the fans slid 'em both together and removed the apostrophe. ""Hip hop lords""? Maybe, but my ways needs laundering. Time's a-ticking, stop squandering!.",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1

Carrie Underwood,Country,Heartbeat,Storyteller,2015.0,"I love it when we're at a party in a downtown crowd, oh. But I can't hear you call me baby with the music up loud. Red wine, good times, no I don't mind being with everyone else. And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself. And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio. And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow. Saying everything without making a sound. A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon. Standing on your shoes in my bare feet. Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat. Oh whoa, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat. I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest. I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath. You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder. Baby, we won't need a song. We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss. What are we waiting on? Yeah, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat. Saying everything without making a sound, with the. River rolling in the background, underneath a harvest moon. We're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat, oh.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
Run-D.M.C.,Hip-Hop,King of Rock,King of Rock,1985.0,"I'm the king of rock, there is none higher. Sucker MCs should call me sire. To burn my kingdom, you must use fire. I won't stop rockin' till I retire. Now we rock the party and come correct. Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect. Got the right to vote and will elect. And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect. They called us and said we're gettin iller. There's no one chiller. It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller. As one def rapper, I know I can hang. I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang. Roll to the rock, rock to the roll. DMC stands for devastating mic control. You can't touch me with a ten foot pole. And I even made the devil sell me his soul. Now we crash through walls, cut through floors. Bust through ceilings and knock down doors. And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box. You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks. For every living person we're a verbal treat. It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat? Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool. I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule. It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool. It's all brand new, never ever old school. You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend. When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend. Music ain't nothin but a people's jam. It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band. Now I walked on ice and never fell. I spent my time in a plush hotel. I stood on many stages, held many mics. Take airplane flights, at huge heights. So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please. Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds. Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees. Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC. I am from, around the way. And Run goes to school, every day. And Jay plays the records he has to play. And we get down with no delay, HEY!. I rock the party with the words I speak. And Run says the rhymes that are unique. And Jay cuts the records every day of the week. And we are the crew that can never be beat. So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend. Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end. The rhymes we say, shall set a trend. Because a devestating rap is what we send. Every jam we play, we break two needles. There's three of us but we're not the Beatles. My name is Darryl, you can call him D. You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC. People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?"". D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean. Like we said before, we rock hardcore. I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can jaw. And now we got the knack, to attract. Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac. We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot. When it comes to rock, give it all we got. To be MC's, we got what it takes. Let the poppers pop and the breakers break. We're cool cool cats, it's like that. That's the way it is, so stay the hell back. We're causin hard times, for sucker MC's. Cause they don't make no songs like these. PERIOD!.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

I'm not half the man I used to be. There's a shadow hanging over me. Oh, yesterday came suddenly. Why she had to go. I don't know, she wouldn't say. I said something wrong. Now I long for yesterday.

Alan Jackson,Country,The Older I Get,,2017.0,"The older I get. The more I think. You only get a minute, better live while you're in it. 'Cause it's gone in a blink. And the older I get. The truer it is. It's the people you love, not the money and stuff. That makes you rich. And if they found a fountain of youth. I wouldn't drink a drop and that's the truth. Funny how it feels I'm just getting to my best years yet. The fewer friends I have. But you don't need a lot when the ones that you got. Have always got your back. The better I am. At knowing when to give. And when to just not give a damn. And I don't mind all the lines. From all the times I've laughed and cried. Souvenirs and little signs of the life I've lived. The longer I pray. I don't know why, I guess that I. Got more to say. The more thankful I feel. For the life I've had, and all the life I'm living still.",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
