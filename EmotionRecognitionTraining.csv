Nirvana,Rock,You Know You’re Right,Nirvana,2002.0,I will never bother you. I will never promise to. I will never follow you. Never speak a word again. I will crawl away for good. I will move away from here. You won't be afraid of fear. No thought was put into this. And always knew it would come to this. Things have never been so swell. I have never failed to fail. He-eee-eee-eeey. He-eee-eee-eey. He-eee-eee-ey. You know you're right. I'm so warm and calm inside. I no longer have to hide. Let's talk about someone else. Steaming soup against her mouth. Nothing really bothers her. She just wants to love himself. Always knew it'd come to this. (He-eee-eee-eey). You know your rights.,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
The Mission UK,Rock,Jade,Another Fall from Grace,2016.0,"She came as Lolita dressed as Venus. And adorned with Stars. With her deft allusion and a Universe between Us. She showed me her skill with words and I showed her my Scars. Don't mistake kindness for affection, she said. Don't ever let the attention go to your Head. No more let Death divide what Life can join Together. But just remember there is nothing that can last Forever. And Jade is Benediction. She is silent Prayer. And Jade is Exaltation. The colours that I wear. And Jade is Contradiction. She is naked but never bare. Jade is a Work, a work of Fiction. Nothing more than Castles in the Air. The shorter the leash the harder I will pull. My glass is Empty when once it was Full. I wish I could be Jesus and turn water into Wine. 'Cause all my grapes have withered, withered on the vine. With a smile like Mercury, elusive and fey. There's a Beauty in the night that can't be seen by day. She's a barbed wire Angel insatiable and cruel. She destroys my resistance like the most Dazzling Jewel. And Jade is Apostasy. Abandoned Faith and Hope. Jade is Hypocrisy. She is Kaleidoscope. And Jade is Precious Stone. Impervious and Rare. And Jade will never atone. For the Flowers in her Hair. And Jade never sleeps alone. There's always someone there. With Jade. To rest their Head on her thigh. To make her moist when she is dry. To hold the Breath of every sigh. To pledge their Life and how to Die. To kiss the sleep from her Eyes. To dry the Tears when she Cries. And Jade is all and Jade is None. And Jade is Moon and she is Sun. And Jade is You and Everyone. And she is Me and and all I've done. And Jade is Lost and she is Won. And Jade is the Bullet shot from your Gun .",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
UB40,Reggae,Food For Thought,Signing Off,1980.0,"Ivory Madonna, dying in the dust. Waiting for the manna coming from the west. Barren is her bosom, empty as her eyes. Death a certain harvest scattered from the skies. Skin and bones is creeping, doesn't know he's dead. Ancient eyes are peeping, from his infant head. Politicians argue sharpening their knives. Drawing up their bargains, trading baby lives. Hear the bells are ringing, Christmas on it's way. Hear the angels singing, what is that they say? Eat and drink rejoicing, joy is hear to stay. Jesus son of Mary is born again today.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

Struck a match to the underground, industry ignited. From metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth. Wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf. Scatting off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily. Tragically, that style deteriorate rapidly. Uncompleted missions, throwing your best known compositions. You couldn't add it up if you mastered addition. Where I come from, getting visuals is habitual. You're more safe walking on hot coals in rituals. I splash the paint on the wall, formed a mural. He took a look, saw the manifestation of it was plural. Rhyming while impaired, dart hit your garment. Pierced your internal streamlined compartments. Just consider the unparalleled advantage. Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage. Bitchass niggas counterfeit the funk. I smoke the bead of the skunk, tree top of the trunk. Moonshine drunken monk, your head get shrunk. Your treasure sunk, I be fucking bitches by the chunk. My name black, you worms wanna play in my dirt. Bitch stop, my Momma serve free lunch from the church. I cum like a thousand doves. Bitch you quiet at the bus, making no fuss, I got self love. Unglove the noose, watch a nigga transfuse. Dirty add to the fuse, heavy at the booze. I don't walk, I get carried. Gold and platinum Frisbees on my wall, looking properly. But comely, I U.F.O. you Wright Brothers. The Indian that sold Manhattan to the white man. My grandfather, step up and get knocked right the fuck out. Come to the cook-out, dirty bitch at the mouth. You scared, run around like the plane about to crash. Wu-Tang motherfuckers. Yeah and RZA.

Wu-Tang Incorp. take your brain on spacewarp. Talk strange like Bjork, great hero Jim Thorpe. How can I put it, life is like video footage. Hard to edit, directors, that never understood it. Too impulsive, my deadly corrosive dosage. Attack when you least notice through explosive postage. I don't play, the rap souffle saute for the day. Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig A Leg Leg Arm Head. Spread like plague, we drink Hennessy by the keg. I got the golden egg plus the goose. Eighty proof Absolut mixed with cranberry fruit juice. Ginseng root, I got your neck in a noose. Keep my money wrinkled, the rap star twinkle killer instinct. Sixteen bar nickel sell more copies than Kinko. Grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us. And we return like Jesus when the whole world need us. Is it appetite for destruction? Slap a murder rap on this production. I touch something, trust nothing. Iron Lung/Twisted Metal. I see 'em ducking my dart gun, busting from every angle. Worldwide total carnage, the sickest flow. That be codenamed Agent Orange, killing you slow. It's only right you pay homage.

We were a thousand miles from nowhere. Wheat fields as far as I could see. Both needing somethin' from each other. Not knowin' yet what that might be. 'Til she came to me one evenin'. Hot cup of coffee and a smile. In a dress that I was certain. She hadn't worn in quite a while. There was a difference in her laughter. There was a softness in her eyes. And on the air there was a hunger. Even a boy could recognize. She had a need to feel the thunder. To chase the lightnin' from the sky. To watch a storm with all its wonder. Ragin' in her lover's eyes. She had to ride the heat of passion. Like a comet burnin' bright. Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been. Burnin' both ends of the night. That summer wind was all around me. Nothin' between us but the night. And when I told her that I'd never. She softly whispered that's alright. And then I watched her hands of leather. Turn to velvet in a touch. There's never been another summer. When I have ever learned so much. We had a need to feel the thunder. Ragin' in each others eyes. We had to ride the heat of passion. I often think about that summer. The sweat, the moonlight and the lace. And I have rarely held another. When I haven't seen her face. And every time I pass a wheat field. And watch it dancin' with the wind. Although I know it isn't real, I just can't help but feel. Her hungry arms again.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

Up in smoke with the fire we started. Misery loves company. I don't need anyone. Smash it up like there's no tomorrow. Leave me here with the fear and sorrow. Tied up to a heart of stone. I screamed into a microphone. I burned the bridge, so I won't find my way home. Lay with me, I can't sleep. When I'm bent, when I'm cracked. When I'm broken. Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down. In the dark awake, and you're not around. And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion. Fifteen times a day when you check your phone.

And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed. And run in thickening streams of greed. As bit by bit it starts the need. To just let go my party piece. The aching kiss before I feed. The stench of a love for a younger meat. And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep. The holding up on bended knees. The addiction of duplicities. But I never said I would stay to the end. So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency. Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy. Screaming me over and over and over. I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery.

Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again. Making it up behind my back again. Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again. Holding it up behind my head again. Cut in the deep to the heart of the bone again. Round and round and round and it's coming apart again. Over and over and over. And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces.

Through the glass of the roof. Through the roof of your mouth. Through the mouth of your eye. Through the eye of the needle. It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven. Than ever feel whole again. I knew I would leave you with babies and everything. Screaming like this in the hole of sincerity. Screaming it over and over and over. Stains on the carpet and stains on the memory.

Do you think you'll be the guy. To make the queen of the angels sigh? She holds her head so high. Like a statue in the sky. Her arms are wicked, and her legs are long. When she moves my brain screams out this song. Sidewalk crouches at her feet. Like a dog that begs for something sweet. Do you hope to make her see, you fool? Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?

Wrapped around your pretty little finger again. It feels like ages since you laid down in my arms. I see no good reason but still I'm tangled in your charms. My God, you're smiling and you catch my eye. My heart is pounding deep inside. Ain't gonna let no man go down without a fight. 'Cause my stalls and walls look better in the bright daylight.

DJ: ""Whatchu wanna hear?"". C: ""I wanna hear that Wu-Tang joint."". DJ: ""Wu-Tang again?"". C: ""Ah, yeah, again and again."". I smoke on the mic like ""Smokin' Joe"" Frazier. The hell-raiser, raisin' hell with the flavor. Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan. Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spider-Man. So uhh, tick-tock and keep tickin'. While I get ya flippin' off the shit I'm kickin'. The Lone Ranger, code red, danger. Deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart. The vandal, too hot to handle. You battle, you're sayin' ""Goodbye"" like Tevin Campbell. Roughneck, Inspectah Deck's on the set. The Rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal. The way I make the crowd go wild, sit back, relax, won't smile. Rae got it goin' on, pal, call me the rap assassinator. Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger. And I'ma get mad deep like a threat. Blow up your project, then take all your assets. 'Cause I came to shake the frame in half. With the thoughts that bomb shit like math. So if you wanna try to flip, go flip on the next man. 'Cause I grab the clip and hit ya with 16 shots and more, I got. Goin' to war with the meltin' pot, akh. It's the Method Man, for short Mr. Meth. Movin' on your left, aah!. And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat. I wanna break full, cock me back. Small change, they puttin' shame in the game. I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame. And like Fame my style'll live forever. Niggas crossin' over, but they don't know no better. But I do, true, can I get a ""suue"". Enough respect due to the one-six-ooh. I mean O, yo check out the flow. Like the Hudson or PCP when I'm dustin'. Niggas off, because I'm hot like sauce. The smoke from the lyrical blunt make me *cough*. Ooh, what, grab my nut, get screwed. Oww, here comes my Shaolin style. True B-A-ba-B-Y-U. To my crew with the ""suuuuue"". Yeah, yeah, yeah. C'mon, baby baby, c'mon, baby baby. C'mon, baby baby, c'mon. Yo, you best protect ya neck. First things first, man, you're fuckin' with the worst. I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a fuckin' nurse. I'll attack any nigga who's slack in his mack. Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack. Shame on you when you step through to. The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zu. And I'll be damned if I let any man. Come to my center, you enter the winter. Straight up and down, that shit is packed jam. You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man. The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin'. Ason Unique rollin' with the night of the creeps. Niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash. Bite my style, I'll bite your motherfuckin' ass. For cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me. Not long is how long that this rhyme took me. Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon. My pen that rocks from here to Oregon. Here's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback. I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back. I come with shit that's all types of shapes and sounds. And where I lounge is my stompin' grounds. I give an order to my peeps across the water. To go and snatch up props all around the border. And get far like a shootin' star. 'Cause who I are is livin' the life of Pablo Escobar. Point-blank as I kick the square biz. There it is, you're fuckin' with pros, and there it goes. Yo, chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that. It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at? Feelin' mad hostile, ran the apostle. Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel. Stroll with the holy roll, then attack the globe with the buckus style. The ruckus, ten times ten men committin' mad sin. Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin. Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums, we'll be. Comin' around the mountain when I come. Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment. My clan increase like black unemployment. Yeah, another one dare, G-Gka-Genius. Take us the fuck outta here. The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels. Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel. Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel. Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table. That's what you get when you misuse what I invent. Your empire falls and you lose every cent. For tryna blow up a scrub. Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb. Should've pumped it when I rocked it. Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets. This goes on in some companies. With majors, they're scared to death to pump these. First of all, who's your A&R? A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar? But he don't know the meanin' of dope. When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap. That's cleaner than a bar of soap. And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight.

Run-D.M.C.,Hip-Hop,Raising Hell,Raising Hell,1986.0,"Kings from Queens from Queens come Kings. We're raisin hell like a class when the lunchbell rings. The king will be praised, and hell will be raised. S-s-s-suckers try to faze him but D won't be fazed. So what's your name? D.M.C.! The King is me!. Your High-ness, or His Majesty!. Now you can debate, you c-c-c-concentrate. But you can't imitate D.M.C. the Great!. Dissin all devils, causin havoc in HELL. At a very high level base and treble shall YELL. Heard in the heavens are the sounds supreme. So clear to the ear it is sometimes seen. So loud like a cloud with thunder and LIGHTNING. So proud to the crowd it is somewhat FRIGHTENING. No calm in the storm like a beast unleashed. There's no stoppin' 'cause the rockin cannot cease; BREAK!. You see it's harder than hard, not one bit soft. Courageous and contagious so you better break North. Not a cold, on a roll, did you hear me cough? Just listen while I'm dissin cause you're pissin me off. Cold bedding is spreading all across your face. You can't take when I break and if that's the case. I'll go on, and on, and kick the bass. So back up off the cup while I take my taste. It's highly appraised when the hell is raised. So demanding and commanding that you all stand dazed. The unbelieving receiving prophecy so true. I cut the head off the Devil and I throw it at you. My mighty mic control, already brought his soul. The rock king is so bold when he rocks and roll. A black hat is my crown, symbolizin the sound. Signifyin, we won't play around; BUST IT!. Rappin and climbin beat-makin every day. No synthesizer sound, so silence when I say. I am great, get it straight, cause that's my fate. My name is Run I'm number one, that's how I rate. He's in the place with the bass, and style and grace. His name is Jay he's here to play, and win this race. He's off the wall, on the ball, his name is D. Kind of tall yes y'all, he's down with me. From the mountain valley to the deep blue sea. The word is heard as told by D. I don't sing I bring, much delight. Like a star shinin bright in the darkest night. If you are cold, I'll bring you heat. Like I brought the whole world my funky beat. Mysterious and serious I ain't no joke. Fire from the depths of hell AND YOU CAN SMELL THE SMOKE!. Kickin and tickin while you're havin a ball. Like chicken finger lickin I'll be vickin you all. So +Do The Bird, have you heard, did they give you a call. Just me and D.M.C., cold shakin the walls. There's no fearin when hearin sound of this kind. Across the land every man is goin out of his mind. On the face of the earth spreading like disease. Contaminating infiltrating like a horde of bees. Lord of lyrics, duke of discussion. Ruler of rock, and king at cold-crushin. Puller of people - controller of crowds. Lingering lyrics, long-lasting and loud. Left y'all, ah to the left y'all. Because I rock upon the mike real def y'all. And to the right y'all, ah to the right y'all. Because I rock upon the mike all night y'all. You see, I. want respect, if I'm correct. They're all like a ball that I have checked. And the shots they take have no effect. The punk tried to dunk but he broke his neck. Cause I rock harder, and I get farther.

Eminem,Hip-Hop,The Ringer,Kamikaze,2018.0,"*Plane crash*. Yeah (Illa, Illa, Illa). Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, 'cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now. Yeah. Let me explain just how to make greatness. Straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break it down. Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout. To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows. If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!). Full magazine could take Staples out. Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account. But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown. Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch. I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'. My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y'all are. To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view. You mention me, millions of views, attention in news. I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you. Billions of views, your ten cents are two. Skim through the music to give shit reviews. To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse. Don't get misconstrued, business as us'. Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do. Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get. What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to. Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow. Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no. Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adios. I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though. Not even dissin', it just ain't for me. All I am simply is just an emcee. Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?). Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean. Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably. Shake the world up if it were up to me. Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill. I should eat a pill, probably I will. Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death. I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath. Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed. Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (""Evil"" spelled). Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick. With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip. Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench. While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch. Like Vice President Mike Pence. Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip. These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic. Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and. Jesus Christ, man, how many times is. Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!). You won't ever see Em icy. But as cold as I get on the M-I-C. I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze. And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it. Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah). Turn down for what? I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa). 'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut. Now when it doesn't matter what caliber. I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks. You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck. Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks? And now he wants to take it out on us"" (Ooouuu). But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy. Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study. It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu). I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that. I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry. Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing). So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'. Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne. I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name. I'm fed up with bein' humble. And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings. I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach. I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo. The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to. What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it? I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two. And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner. If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner. I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it. I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper. You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's. But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival. But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider. Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned. And you woulda bought it. But sayin' I no longer got it. 'Cause you missed a line and never caught it. 'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it. 'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest. With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist. And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless. What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa). Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it. Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic. With a bottle full of malt liquor. But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer. The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom. If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet. I don't see why y'all even started with me. I get in beefs, my enemies die. I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased. I'm east side, never be caught slippin'. Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink. I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats. I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze. ""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage. The Thing ain't even orangeoh my God, that's a reach!"". Shout to all my colorblind people. Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green. Aquamarine, or you think water is pink. ""Dawg, that's a date."" ""Looks like an olive to me."". ""Look, there's an apple!"" ""No, it's not, it's a peach!"". So finger-bang, Pootie Tang. Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang. Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say. Give me Donkey of the Day. What a way for 2018 to get underway. But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say. Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah). Invite 'em in like a One A Day. I'm not done (Preach!). 'Cause I feel like the beast of burden. That line in the sand, was it even worth it? 'Cause the way I see people turning's. Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose. I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds. And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word. Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict. Or still yet to be determined? 'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped. But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it. And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent. Sold the dream to that he's deserted. But I think it's workin'. These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous. And he's too scurred to answer me with words. 'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered. But I know at least he's heard it. 'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service. To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him. Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists. I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists."". But my beef is more media journalists. (Hold up, hold up, hold up). I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist. Can get a mouthful of flesh. And yes, I mean eating a penis. 'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death. So I've been givin' the media fingers. Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh. But they've been puttin' me through the ringer. So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press. But I just took this beat to the cleaners.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1

Stand dying in the dairy yard. And a hundred lonely housewives. Clutch empty milk bottles to their hearts. Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry. It's enough to make you stop believing. When tears come fast and furious. In a town called Malice. Struggle after struggle, year after year. The atmosphere's a fine blend of ice. I'm almost stone cold dead. A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef. Gets dashed against the Co-op. To either cut down on beer or the kids' new gear. It's a big decision in a town called Malice. The ghost of a steam train echoes down my track. It's at the moment bound for nowhere. Just going 'round and 'round. Playground kids and creaking swings. Lost laughter in the breeze. I could go on for hours and I probably will. But I'd sooner put some joy back. In this town called Malice.",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

For all my sorrow and my pain. A feeling so alone. What's the difference anyway. When all the people do all day. Is stare into a phone. I'll never be there.,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1
Snoop Dogg,Hip-Hop,Doggy Dogg World,Doggystyle,1993.0,"Can we get a motherfuckin moment of silence. For the small chronic break? A-hah, niggas be brown-nosing these hoes and shit. Taking bitches out to eat, and spending money on these hoes. Know what I'm saying? I treat a bitch like 7-Up, I never have I never will. I tell a bitch like this:. ""Bitch, you without me is like Harold Melvin without Bluenotes. You'll never go platinum!"". Hey Daz, give me a light nigga. We'd like to welcome y'all to the fabulous Carolina West. I own this motherfucker and my name is Taa-Dow. Y'all niggas know who I am, y'all niggas tearin' up shit. But we got somethin' old, and somethin' new for y'all tonight.

But it ain't no thang, cause, see, my homie Coolio. Put me up on the game when I stepped through the door. Some of these niggas is so deceptive. Using my styles like a contraceptive. I hope you get burnt. Seems you haven't learnt. It's the knick-knack, patty-whack. I still got the biggest sack!. So put your gun away, run away, cause I'm back. Hit em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up. Now, tell me, what's going on? It make me wanna holler, cause my dollars come in O-zones. Known for break off so take off your clothes. And quit trying to spit at my motherfuckin' hoes!. Speaking of hoes, I'll get to the point. You think you got the bomb cause I rolled you a joint? You'se a flea, and I'm the Big Dogg. I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin' paws. Y'alls niggas better recognize. And see where I'm coming from: it's still Eastside. Til I die. Why ask why? As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-double G, Y. It's a crazy, mixed-up world. It's a Doggy Dogg World. Well if you give me 10 bitches then I'll fuck all 10. Seen the homie Snoop Doggy sipping juice and gin. Don't slip, I'm for the set-trip, to get papers. Styles vary, packing flavor like Lifesavers. Ain't that something? Talk shit and I'm dumpin'. I had your whole fuckin' block bumpin'. Don't sweat, but check the technique. I'm unique like China. You'll never find a bomber rhymer than this nigga behind ya. So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through. 1, 2, 3: you can't see me. I'm a G like that, strapped with hit-hard tactics. A fuckin' menace, using hoes like tennis rackets. It's on again, It's on and poppin'. All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'. I wanna see some panties droppin'. I'm coming from L.A. She used to chill with Dre up in Compton. (All I ever did was just use that ho. Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows). I'm dishin out blues, I'm upsettin' like bad news. Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes. Kurupt, the name's often marked for catchin' slugs. And I smoke weed for the fuck of it. Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanatory how I gets wicked. But it's mandatory that I kick it. Check it, I'm runnin' hoes in 94, now must I prove it. Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin' and movin'. Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head huntin'. Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn. Peep, the massacre from a verbal assassin. Murderin' with rhymes packin' Tec-9's for some action. You really don't know, do you, you fuckin' wit a hog. You can't do me, I'm goin' out looney like O-Dog. Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (all night long). Til when? (Til the early morn'). And it don't stop, and it don't quit. For tha Dogg Pound clique to drop the cavi dough. Diggity-Daz out of the motherfuckin' cut once more. So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow. I flip-flop and serve hoes with a fat dick. Til I die, I'm still screaming out: ""bitches ain't shit!"". Now I'm the mack daddy, had he not known about. The city where I'm from: Dum diddy dum. As you groove to the gangster shit. The D-O-double G, the P-O-U-N-D. The gangster clique. Now as the Pound break it down with the gangster funk. I can see and I can tell that's what the fuck you want. Then I blaze up the chronic so I can get high.

Freeze cause these are the brothers. Brothers of the Soul who present a new flick. Every last viewer is tuned to the method. Known to be a method, no magicians, not a trick. Bitten by the spoken who been titled Plug Two. Swallowed by the loonies who are jealous with the showbiz. Dove'll teach the truth, Posdnuos will preach the youth. To the fact that this will bring an end to the negative. Flow to the sway cause I say fa-so-la-ti. At the top we will dwell. Difference is fame and we rise then we build. Where we are set we get fat and we swell. Motions of the Soul is a positive stride. One step forward is the space we consume. Vivid as the moon, you have yet to assume. How the Soul found the motto of a naughty noise called. Vocal is local so believe that. This chant sends L.I. on the strong map. Trying and live so you best realize. That the gift that I present, I say gift wrap. Style of the Tune is personal. And defining what's the rhyme is worst of all. Stop, sit and study cause the meaning isn't muddy. Just preach and do the gear as the first of all. Watch while the pitcher is pitching. Cause this is the pitch of the year. Sing a simple song but keep the swing strong. Though you heard Dove crying, I ain't fearing. Those who think De La's on the flip tip. Try to flip this and you're doomed. Watch for the B-B cause if you try to grieve me.

I'm expressing with my full capabilities. And now I'm living in correctional facilities. Cause some don't agree with how I do this. I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist. I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary. But my technique is very necessary. Blame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky. When you got a subject and a predicate. Add it on a dope beat and that'll make you think. Some suckers just tickle me pink. To my stomach, cause they don't flow like this one. You know what? I won't hesitate to dis one. Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this. Some drop science, well I'm dropping English. Even if Yella makes it a cappella. I still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess.

Now, getting back to the PG. That's program, and it's easy. Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow. Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow. The words, the style, the trend, the records I spin. Again and again and again, yo, you on the other end. Watch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help. There's no fessing and guessing while I'm expressing myself. It's crazy to see people be. What society wants them to be, but not me. Ruthless is the way to go, they know. Others say rhymes that fail to be original. Or they kill where the hip-hop starts. Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts. Some musicians cuss at home. But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone. Yeah, they want reality but you won't hear none. They rather exaggerate a little fiction. Some say no to drugs and take a stand. But after the show they go looking for the dopeman. Or they ban my group from the radio, hear N.W.A and say ""Hell no!"". But you know it ain't all about wealth as long as you make a note to. From the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart. Then expression is a big part of it. You ain't efficient when you flow. You ain't swift, moving like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis. There's a little bit more to show. I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo. Or a lesson, all of 'em expression. And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wesson for you. I might ignore your record because it has no bottom. I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn. It's Dre on the mic, getting physical. Doing the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob. Yes, I'm macabre but you know you need this. And the knowledge is growing, just like a fetus. Or a tumor but here's the rumor. Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good. When I start expressing myself, Yella slam it. Cause If I stay funky like this, I'm doing damage. Or I'mma be too hyped and need a straight jacket. I got knowledge and other suckers lack it. So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic. Ask what it's like, it's like we getting hype tonight. Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health. But I won't strike if you just.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1

I ain't no nigga, fuck that shit. Does everything come out your mouth got to be a 4-letter word? All over this bullshit, it's just a bunch of fuckin' noise. The way you talk about women is bullshit, plain bullshit. What you motherfuckers doin' for the black community anyway?

How can you call yourself a nigga and be proud of it? {*monitor stops beeping - R.I.P.*}. Flatline. Bullshit!. Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me? Well it's because motherfuckers wanna blast me. And run me outta my neighborhood. And label me as a dope dealer yo, and say that I'm no good. But I gave out jobs so niggas wouldn't have to go out. Gave em some dope and a corner so they could show out. When the cops came, they gave a fake name. Because the life in the streets is just a head game. So therefore, to make more. A 15-year-old black kid'll go and rob a liquor store. And get shot in the process. He ate up a nine bullet and now he's put to rest. I guess it's just the way shit has to be.

A million white motherfuckers on my back like I shot the President. Because my mouth is so motherfuckin' nasty. Bitch this, bitch that, nigga this, nigga that. In the mean while my pockets are gettin' fat. Gettin' paid to say this shit here. Makin' more in a week than a doctor makes in a year. So why not call myself a nigga? It's better than pullin' the trigger and goin' up the river. And then I get called a nigga anyway. Broke as a motherfucker and locked away, so. So cut out all that bullshit. I guess I'll be a nigga for life. (""Niggas, crackers, jews!"". ""If there's hell below, we're all gonna go!""). Nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga, please. I'm treated like a fuckin' disease. You say - why do I call myself a nigga so quick? Cause I can reach in my drawers and pull out a bigger dick, yo. Nigga say nigga we cool but. Cracker say nigga, nigga knocked the fuck up. But I gotta be a fast nigga, to never be the last nigga. Or I'll have to beat yo' ass, nigga. In the city you see action first. Then hear about it later in a verse I curse. Because I'm real with this to keep my shit straight bumpin. Murder, created by the streets of Compton. Now get it from the underground poet. I live it, I see it, and I write it because I know it. And if you think I'm fuckin' your wife. You're motherfuckin' right yo, cause I'm a nigga for life. I love niggas, I love niggas, I love niggas. Because niggas are me. And I should only love that which is me. I love that you niggas (""niggas for life""). Nigga this, nigga that. The actual fact is that I'm black and bound to attract. The attention of another, I mean the other. But I'm a motherfucker that'll have 'em runnin' for cover. You see, I don't give a fuck about nothin'. Except gettin' paid, gettin' bitches, and issuin' stitches. Which is, all needed to read it and find a rhyme. And then it's time to say, the nigga's here to stay. But what about the fake niggas, the house niggas. To get paid quick they gotta suck a fat dick. But N.W.A. is outta your motherfuckin' range. We ain't gonna change a motherfuckin' thang!.

The one with the glint in her eyes. The girl that seldom loses. Beautiful, with grace and style. Acting out her story. Standing in her glory. Happy ever after. Wish I had a nickel for each dime I've spent. Watching others live their lives with confidence. Here's a preview of some things to come. It's not too late for me to be someone. I can't keep living in their make-believe. Coming attractions will be starring me. The one with the stars in her eyes (In her eyes). She gets the roles she chooses. She can laugh or she can cry. Acting in her story. Always happy endings. It's time I show the world just what I'm about. I'm steppin' up and I'm steppin' out. I'm feelin' bold and I'm feelin' proud. I want to be that girl. Hmm hmm. Hmm hmm hmm. Gonna stand up. And I'm gonna matter. 'Cause I've had enough of my dreams being shattered. And I've had enough of my tears being splattered. I've already been that girl.

50 Cent,Hip-Hop,Big Rich Town,Power (Soundtrack from the Starz Original Series),2014.0,"They say this is a big, rich town. I just come from the poorest part. Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it. This is where it goes down. I just happen to come up hard. Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it. I never took a straight path nowhere, life's full of twist and turns. Bumps and bruises, I live, I learn. I'm from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers. It's hard to get a start in these parts without paper. Homie, I grew up in hell, a block away from heaven. That corner every 15 minutes it move a seven. Pure snow, bag it then watch it go. Occupational options, get some blow or some hoes. Shoot the bowl or the strap, learn to rap or to jack. Fuck it, man, in the mean time go ahead and pump a pack. This my regal royal flow, my James Bond bounce. That 007, that 62 on my count. I'm a undercover liar, I lie under the covers. Look a bitch in the eyes and tell her ''baby, I love it''. You're my inspiration, you're my motivation. You're the reason that I'm moving it with no hesitation. I gotta hustle through the hustle and bust while I make a move. Manuever around the rats and wolves, I'm from the school. Of hard knocks, shots pop, bodies drop. Graveyard, pick a block cause niggas want your spots. I'm trying to stack shit then I go legit. Hollow tip, stuff 'em in a clip case niggas trip. My cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties. I'm supposed to lose, watch me win against the odds. All I got is my word, balls and my instinct. I'm trying to make it, we already made it my friends think. We already on top, I got a bigger plan. No more controlled substances or hand to hand. White collar visions, game changing mission. Big risks, big wins, equal bigger living. Perfect position, watch me transition. From caterpillar to butterfly in the sky.",1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0

But even without those three. Eye know you'll be close to me cause. It's I again and the soul that I send. Is taking steps to reach your heart. Any moment you feel alone.

I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase ""fuck nigga"". He said, ""Think about what you saying: ""Fuck niggas"". No better than Samuel on the Django. No better than a white man with slave boats"". Sound like I needed some soul searching. My Pops gave me some game in real person. Retraced my steps on what they never taught me. Did my homework fast before government caught me. So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah. On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us. So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us. Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia. N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen. N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish. The history books overlook the word and hide it. America tried to make it to a house divided. The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong. So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song. N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more. Black stars can come and get me. Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time. Kendrick Lamar, by far, realest Negus alive.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1

We're gonna have a problem here. Y'all act like you never seen a white person before. Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door. And started whoopin' her ass worse than before. They first were divorced, suin' her over furniture (Agh!). It's the return of the ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding. He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"". And Dr. Dre said nothing, you idiots!. Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!). Feminist women love Eminem. ""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him. Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what. Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though."". Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose. But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms. Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose. But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose. ""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"". And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss. And that's the message that we deliver to little kids. And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is. Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is. By the time they hit fourth grade. They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they? We ain't nothin' but mammalswell, some of us, cannibals. Who cut other people open like cantaloupes. But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes. Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope. But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote. Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes. I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady. All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating. So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up? 'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady. Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope). Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!. You think I give a damn about a Grammy? Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me. ""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"". Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here? So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears? Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs. So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst. And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first. Little bitch put me on blast on MTV. ""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee."". I should download her audio in MP3. And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!). I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups. All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you. And there's a million of us just like me. Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me. Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me. And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me. I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you. Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room. The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all. And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all. I just get on the mic and spit it. And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it. Better than 90% of you rappers out can. Then you wonder: ""How can. Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"". It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm 30. I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting. Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens. And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working. And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking. He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings. Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!"". With his windows down and his system up. So will the real Shady please stand up. And put one of those fingers on each hand up? And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control. And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go? Ha ha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us. Fuck it, let's all stand up!.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

The Cure,Rock,Lullaby,Disintegration,1989.0,"I spy. Something beginning with 'S'. On candy stripe legs the Spiderman comes. Softly through the shadow of the evening sun. Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead. Looking for the victim shivering in bed. Searching out fear in the gathering gloom. And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room. And there is nothing I can do when I realize with fright. That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight. Quietly he laughs and shaking his head. Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed. And softer than shadow and quicker than flies. His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes. Be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy. Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more. For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light. The Spiderman is having you for dinner tonight. And I feel like I'm being eaten. By a thousand million shivering furry holes. And I know that in the morning. I will wake up in the shivering cold. And the Spiderman is always hungry.

A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart. Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart? Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue.

You know you need and want my love, yet you're afraid to try. Why do you run and hide from life, to try it just ain't smart. There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me.

I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch. Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak. Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville. Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest. I wish that he had more guidance, for real. Too many niggas in cycle of jail. Spending they birthdays inside of a cell. We coming from a long bloodline of trauma.

I have become comfortably numb. Okay (okay, okay, okay...). Just a little pinprick *ding*. There'll be no more... (aah!). But you may feel a little sick. Can you stand up? (stand up, stand up...). I do believe it's working, good. That'll keep you going through the show. Come on, it's time to go. When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse. Out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look, but it was gone. I cannot put my finger on it now. The child is grown, the dream is gone.",0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1
The Church,Rock,Block,"Uninvited, Like the Clouds",,"I was down in the city on a miracle street. I flailed like a swimmer through the summer heat. I was waiting for a friend that I needed to meet. And I's hoping she was bringing with her something sweet. And I's hoping for an open little opening. And I suffer for a groovy little happening. But it's all going wrong just like I sing in that song. The song that I wrote about you that they put on TV. The TV that I gave you cuz you wanted to see. But all they saw were spaces where the people used to be. A hundred bastard voids with their pull on me. In the valley of death you'll be breathless and free. You'll be dancing like a fool by the swollen sea. You'll be twitching like a drunk in a pharmacy. You'll be swatting at the flies in your pavilion. Where the millionaire just blew a gazillion. The finger nails are all hot vermilion. And the traffic grinds down to a stand-still-ion. And the mynah birds are pecking at the carrion. And you read it already in Hyperion. And you read about my trial in the Clarion. A sack full of ashes I've been carry'n. When the lights turn green I dissolve the screen. When the lights turn red I put the whole thing to bed. Well I've got a fever. And I'm feeling fainter. I'm a dim receiver. I'm a Cold War painter. If you can just hold still. I will make you all so beautiful. When the lights turn blue I know what to do. I'll drown my tomorrows in an ocean or two. And the pretty little things with their magnets and rings. Blooming like a flower through a series of springs. Thank you Fate and the freight that she brings. Thank you Fortuna and that song that she sings. Thank you to my manager for letting me live. Thank you to my friends and the friends that you're with. Thank you to the lord who created all of this. There's a whole lot of hurt before you get to the bliss. Why even Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss. But that was long before that he got in show biz. Well I understand the land, and the land ain't no sea. But when I try to walk I'm sinking you see. So I got a fever. If you could just hold still.",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

To the ends of the earth, would you follow me? There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see. If you won't I must say my goodbyes to thee. Oh, there's an island where all things are silent. I'm gonna whistle a tune. Oh, there's a desert, that's size can't be measured. I'm gonna count all the dunes. Out there's a world that calls for me, girl. Headin' out into the unknown.

Kenny Chesney,Country,I Go Back,When the Sun Goes Down,2004.0,"""Jack and Diane"" painted a picture of my life and my dreams. Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me. Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along. Because every time I hear that song. I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy. Driving my first love out to the levee. Living life with no sense of time. And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line. A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine. Wishing time would stop right in its tracks. Every time I hear that song, I go back. I go back. I used to rock all night long to ""Keep On Rocking Me Baby"". Frat parties, college bars, just trying to impress the ladies. And I go back to the smell of an old gym floor. And the taste of salt on a Carolina shore. After graduation and drinking goodbye to friends. And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall. Growin up too fast and I do recall. Wishin time would stop right in its tracks. Everytime I hear that song, I go back. We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives. Takes us to another place and time. So I go back to a pew, preacher, and a choir. Singing bout God, brimstone, and fire. And the smell of Sunday chicken after church. And I go back to the loss of a real good friend. And the sixteen summers I shared with him. Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks. Every time I hear that song. To the feel of a fifty yard line. I go back (I go back). To watching summer fade to fall. Growing up too fast and I do recall. To the loss of a real good friend.

How many things I pray the father will forgive. One situation involved a young man. He was the ocean and I was the sand. He stole my heart like a thief in the night. Dulled my senses blurred my sight. I chose the road of passion and pain (passion and pain). Sacrificed too much and waited in vain. Gave up my power ceased being queen. Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend. See, torn and confused wasted and used. Reached the crossroad which path would I choose. Stuck and frustrated I waited, debated. For something to happen that just wasn't fated. Thought what I wanted was something I needed. When momma said no I just should have heeded. Misled I bled 'till the poison was gone. And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn. Father you saved me and you showed me that life. Was much more than being some foolish man's wife. Showed me that love was respect and devotion. Greater than planets and deeper than any oceans. See, my soul was weary but now it's replenished. Content because that part of my life is finished. I see him sometimes and the look in his eye. Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold. But my heart is gold I took back my soul. And totally let my creator control. The life which was his, the life which was his to begin with.

Me against the world, baby. Can you picture my prophecy? Stress in the city, the cops is out for me. The projects is full of bullets. Though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me. Constantly movin' while makin' millions. Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings. Can't reach the children, 'cause they're illin'. Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'. Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted? Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket. The aftermath: more bodies bein' buried. I'm losin' my homies in a hurry, they're relocatin' to the cemetery. Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry. The question is will I live, no one in the world loves me. I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers. Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger. Don't wanna make excuses. 'Cause this is how it is, what's the use? Unless we're shootin', no one notices the youth. Me against the world. 'Cause it's just me against the world, baby. Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself, see. Ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy. Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'. Seein' Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons. Already crazy and screamin', I guess them nightmares as a child. Had me scared but left me prepared for a while. Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw? Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall. Everyday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less. I'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'. Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'. 'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up. My nuts is backed up, I'm about to act up. Go load the MAC up, now watch me klacka. Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'. And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'. So what? Go put some work in and make my mail. Makin' sales, riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well. With nothin' to lose. With all this extra stressin'. The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath. When will I finally get to rest through this oppression? They punish the people that's askin' questions. And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions. The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons. Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions. Be grateful for blessings. Don't ever change, keep your essence. The power is in the people and politics we address. Always do your best, don't let this pressure make you panic. And when you get stranded. And things don't go the way you planned it. Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference. Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen. If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change. It wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world. Got me stuck in the game. Hahaha, that's right. I know it seem hard sometimes. But, uh, remember one thing. Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that. So no matter how hard it get. Stick your chest out, keep your head up, and handle it.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

Her green-eyed girl was a mother to be for 2 weeks. I was out of a job and she was in school. Life was fast and the world was cruel. We were young and wild. We decided not to have a child. So we did what we did and we tried to forget. And we swore up and down. There would be no regrets. In the morning light. But on the way home that night. On the back of that red rag top. Loving me. We took one more trip around the sun. It was all make believe in the end. No I can't say where she is today. I can't remember who I was back then. Well, you do what you do and you pay for your sins. And there's no such thing as what might've been. That's a waste of time; drive you outta your mind. I was stopped at a red light just yesterday. Beside a young girl in a cabriolet. And her eyes were green. I was in an old scene. I was back in that red rag top. On the day she stopped.",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby. I think it's too late for praying, hold up. A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying. (Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better). How long will I live? (Eternal life and forever). And will I be the G that I was? (I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of. So relax your soul, let me take control. Close your eyes my son) my eyes are closed. Murder. Murder was the case that they gave me. I'm fresh up out my coma. I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner. It's gonna take a miracle they say. For me to walk again and talk again but anyway. I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet. And everything that nigga said came to reality. Living like a baller loc. Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke. I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag. And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rag.

I pray the Lord, my soul to take. No more indo, gin and juice. I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose. Shackled from head to toe. Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know. Them niggas from the other side recognize my face. Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C. Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care. Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair. Niggas stare as I enter the center. They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay. Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor. Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off. Cause you can't tell what's next. My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck. And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two.

That I almost believe that the pictures are. All I can feel. Remembering you. Standing quiet in the rain. As I ran to your heart to be near. And we kissed as the sky fell in. Holding you close. How I always held close in your fear. Running soft through the night. You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow. And screamed at the make-believe. Screamed at the sky. And you finally found all your courage. To let it all go. Fallen into my arms. Crying for the death of your heart. You were stone white. So delicate. Lost in the cold. You were always so lost in the dark. How you used to be. Slow drowned. You were angels. So much more than everything. Hold for the last time then slip away quietly. Open my eyes. But I never see anything. If only I'd thought of the right words. I could have held on to your heart. I wouldn't be breaking apart. All my pictures of you. Looking so long at these pictures of you. But I never hold on to your heart. Looking so long for the words to be true. But always just breaking apart. My pictures of you. There was nothing in the world. That I ever wanted more.

What took you so long to answer motherfucker? I don't know. The fuck wrong with you, bitch? When I met you, I admit, my first thoughts was to trick. You look so good, huh, I suck on your daddy's dick. I never felt that way in my life. It didn't take long before I made you my wife. Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze. Comin' to the crib, even had a set a keys. During the days you helped me bag up my nickels. In the process, I admit, I tricked a little. But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch. Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin' rich. And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right. I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right.

One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet. Throwin' my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows. I see my Polos and Timbos. Hide my car keys so I can't leave. A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve. And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly. She'll invite me, politely, to fight, G. And then we lie together, cry together. I swear to God I hope we fuckin' die together. (Nigga, nigga, if I ever). (Catch your ass fuckin' around). (I'll cut your motherfuckin' dick off). (Haha). (Stop playin').

Didn't hesitate to squeeze to get my life out of danger. One day, she put 911 on the pager. Had to call back, whether it's minor or major. No response, the phone just rung. Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem. When I pulled up, police was on the scene. Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean. Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes. Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes. It didn't take long before the tears start. I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart. And I know it was meant for me. I guess the niggas felt they had to kill the closest one to me. And when I find 'em your life is to an end.

The Notorious B.I.G.,Hip-Hop,Everyday Struggle,Ready to Die,1994.0,"I don't wanna live no more. Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door. I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle. Another day, another struggle (Right). I know how it feel to wake up fucked up. Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell. People look at you like you's the user. Sellin' drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser. But they don't know about your stress-filled day. Baby on the way, mad bills to pay. That's why you drink Tanqueray, so you can reminisce. And wish you wasn't livin' so devilish, shit. I remember I was just like you. Smokin' blunts with my crew, flippin' over 62's. 'Cause G-E-D wasn't B-I-G. I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me. She was forced to kick me out, no doubt. Then I figured out nicks went for 20s down South. Packed up my tools for my raw power move. Glock 19 for casket and flower moves. For chumps tryin' to stop my flow. And what they don't know will show on the autopsy. Went to see Papi to cop me a brick. Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it. Smokin' mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court. For an assault that I caught in Bridgeport, New York. Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man. You better have your gat in hand, 'cause man. I had the master plan, I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland. With my man Two-TECs to take over this projects. They call him Two-TECs, he tote two TECs. And when he start to bust, he like to ask, ""Who's next?"". I got my honey on the Amtrak with the crack. In the crack of her ass, two pounds of hash in the stash. I wait for hon to make some quick cash. I told her she could be lieutenant, bitch got gassed. At last, I'm literally loungin', black. Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks. Had to re-up, see what's up with my peeps. Toyota deal-athon had it cheap on the Jeeps. See who got smoked, what rumors was spread. Last I heard I was dead, with six to the head. Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder. We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter. Heard TEC got murdered in a town I never heard of. By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners. And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch. I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich. Conspiracy, she'll be home in three. Until then I looks out for the whole family. A true G, that's me, blowin' like a bubble. In the everyday struggle. I'm seein' body after body and our mayor Giuliani. Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti. My daughter use a potty so she's older now. Educated street knowledge, I'ma mold her now. Trick a little dough buyin' young girls fringes. Dealin' with the dope fiend binges, seein' syringes. In the veins, hard to explain how I maintain. The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange. Breakin' days on the set, no sweat. Drunk off Moet, can't bag yet because it's still wet. But when that dry, baggin' five at a time. I can clock about nine on the check cashin' line. I had the first and the third, rehearse, that's my word. Thick in the game, D's knew my first name. Should I quit? Shit no, even though they had me scared. Yo, they got a eight, I got a TEC with air holes. And that's just how the shit go in the struggle, motherfucker. Hah, come on, what you say? Junior M.A.F.I.A. right. Yeah, rock on, woo!.

Ain't nobody graduatin'. Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it. That's why I gotta hate it. Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration. Damn, I'm gettin' aggravated.

So many days I had a vision of me breaking out. But I decided to be strong and just wait it out. Even though I had my ways behind the prison walls. I couldn't get my calling time I was away from Y'all. I've forgiven everybody. For trying to rise up against me. They were saying they didn't believe me. Only God can judge me.

I skied on crystal pathways. To a mountain peak so tall. And I walked the mighty summits. With the one who made it all. And I fell in love with a lady. 'Cause I've seen her at her best. And I've walked her wild and rugged paths. Through her open wilderness. And now I never can betray her. Steal her riches and be gone. 'Cause when you love a mountain lady. You're gonna sing a mountain song. Now people come from everywhere. To see what they can find. And some take lots of pictures. And some just take their time. But they're some who take her beauty. That can't be bought or sold. And they think of only money. While destroying wealth untold. But you fall in love with a lady. When you've slept upon her breast. To her open wilderness. And you never can betray her.,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Kenny Chesney,Country,Wild Child,The Big Revival,2014.0,"Looks like royal in a thrift store dress. Keeps my heart and her hair a mess. She goes where the wind suggests she goes, who knows. Got a spirit that can't be tamed. She's a calico pony on an open plain. I know I'll never be the same no more, for sure. She's a wild child. Got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy wild style. She can't be tied down but for a while. I'll be falling free and so in love. Might break my heart but God she drives me wild child. You've never heard of her favorite band unless you. Been to Bonnaroo or Burning Man. She's Penny Lane in a Chevy van, she loves to love. She loves me wild child. She'll be here until she runs. Some just have to chase the sun. A kaleidoscope of colors in her mind child. A touch of crazy hides behind her wild smile. So simple yet experimental. Innocent but still a little wild child. Wild child.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
Busta Rhymes,Hip-Hop,Can You Keep Up?,,2011.0,"Now it's finna be some energy, we got the remedy. I'm in the vicinity of a nigga that can spit it with me. Feel the fire whenever we act up. Everybody else is incompatible with the artillery. So forget about it when you hear about it. Cause it's too fast when I pass the baton to Busta. Hit a victim in the middle of the body with a bullet and a rhythm. Every murder is a structure. Every time I hit you niggers with another jam be blacking. I be sounding like a nigga full of anger.

We can hit 'em like a couple of millimeters. Woopin' a niggas' ass. Skibbedy boop, skibbedy bop, skibbedy beep. I'm skipping all over on another Just Blaze hit. Now I know a lot of y'all been sitting, waiting and wondering. Was we ever gonna do this shit. And then we came to hit 'em with another flow. Pop champagne, celebrate and kill another show. Gotta campaign, the greatest niggas, y'all already know that. Never do this kinda shit, Twista, get 'em, gotta go. Now I gotta ask y'all. Can you keep up? Now try to catch me if you can. Now try to catch (Now try to catch me). Kill everybody cause I'm gunning outta stress. If I'm running outta breath, he gonna pick up where I left off. Keep him with me when he spitting cause the flow be the bidness. I'm a menace when I bust a lyrical tec off. Go faster than Ricky Bobby, kill him in Talladega Nights. Niggas try to get up, when a nigga hit up. When it I come I promise you gotta pay the price. Look, why don't everybody wanna come and try get a little taste. Of the shit I got, let me put it all up in your face. When I spit it I got a nigga wilding all over the place. Everybody better listen here. Cause you know when I bring him I will never, never stop. Make a nigga rewind and bring it back to the top. Throw the shit up in the streets and I be running every block. Everybody better stand clear. Like a millimeter when I be booking the track up. Motivated for murder whenever I act up. A couple of phenomenal niggas can stack up. Gets anybody that wanna live in the back up. Killing everybody when I bust a clip off. Cause I'mma be attacking them with the insane flow. Then I be having them calling me Twista Phelps. And my nigga Buss like Usain Bolt. Shocked a nigga like I was a thousand volts. Now I'm sailing on the beat the way I'm sailing on the boat. The way I gotta kill 'em and the way I gotta flow. You don't really wanna test me, boy, cause I'll pop ya. When I'm in the spot you know you can't leave. I spit every word 'till, damn I can't breathe. You never heard 'till you nosebleed. Twista, please. Now you know I got ya. You can talk about it with a bunch of people. That say that I'm a lyrical manifestation of rhythem. Then I come and do the shit I gotta do and then I bang 'em. And get 'em and do it every single time I hit 'em. When I do it its gotta be accurate. Like I'm attacking the rhythm with such a vocal tenacity. See the way a brother blacking I'm back and infant. Cause every time we in the place you feeling the capacity. I be coming with it, he be coming with it. And nobody really do it how we do it. And the flow is so fluid I gotta be an anomaly. Gotta be an Odyssey; the prodigy, and I'mma be the one to prove it. Don't you ever forget it the way we coming. And they sending somebody, gonna probably be needing a medic. So give us the credit and I thought that we should oughta. Be coming to slaughter so call out the order see the way we do it.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

Manic Street Preachers,Rock,Mausoleum,The Holy Bible,1994.0,"Wherever you go I will be carcass. Whatever you see will be rotting flesh. Humanity recovered glittering etiquette. Answers her crimes with mausoleum rent. Regained your self-control. And regained your self-esteem. And blind your success inspires. And analyse, despise and scrutinise. Never knowing what you hoped for. And safe and warm but life is so silent. For the victims who have no speech. In their shapeless guilty remorse. Obliterates your meaning. Your meaning, your meaning. No birds - no birds. The sky is swollen black. Holy mass of dead insect. Come and walk down memory lane. No one sees a thing but they can pretend. Life eternal scorched grass and trees. For your love nature has haemorrhaged. ""I wanted to rub, uhm, the human face in its own vomit, and force it to look in the mirror."". And life can be as important as death. But so mediocre when there's no air, no light and no hope. Prejudice burns brighter when it's all we have to burn. The world lances youth's lamb-like winter, winter.",0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1

When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb? Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch? If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich? Come here baby why you always insecure? Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure. Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest. A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest. I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants. I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas. 'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine. My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun. In fact I just might need two, cause niggas say they the one. And I got something to prove. Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW. My inhibition's fighting my intuition. Premature premonition, showing me the demolition. Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time. Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing. You want the truth well come and listen. I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing. As fate passes you by, half of you try. The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly. One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be. A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me. Keep it true like me, Cole you might be.

Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me!. BLAOOOW!. (Who's the king?). Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt. What you expected from me, I came from the dirt. Money my motivator, the songs that I sing. Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king. You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go. Will I return or will I burn, never know. Look in my eyes and see the future. But don't sugar coat it. Listen. History repeats itself and that's just how it goes. Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows. Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll. Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore. While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown. Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound. This year I'll prolly go to the awards dappered down. Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile. I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit. Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with. But not Jermaine, my aim too sick. I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick. You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid. I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid. And break the chains and change minds. One verse at a time, and claim 2-6. And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king? We all kings. (We all kings nigga). Kings of ourselves first and foremost. (True). While the people debate who's the king of this rap game. Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine. With every ounce of strength in his veins. To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it. But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it. Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic. With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates. And falls to the Earth from which it came. It's done. Ain't gonna be no more kings. Be wary of any man that claims. Because deep down he clings onto the need for power. The reality, he's a coward. Ultimately he's scared to die. And sometimes so am I. But when I'm in tune with the most high. I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side. Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I. Different kind of skin, different set of eyes. Two different minds, but only one God. (It's only one God nigga). It's for all the kings. 'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved.",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1

All you other motherfuckers get out my business (really). Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back. I couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats. Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed. And hocus pocus, I try to focus, but I can't see. And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time. Look to my future, 'cause my past is all behind me. Is it a crime to fight for what is mine? Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use of tryin'. I've been trapped since birth, cautious 'cause I'm cursed. And fantasies of my family in a hearse. And they say it's the White man I should fear. But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here. I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side. Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died. Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for. Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door. And all my memories of seein' brothers bleed. And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees. Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix. 'Cause the media is full of dirty tricks. Only God can judge me. Only God can judge me, only God. I hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' I can make it. Got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked. Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV. 'Cause everytime I breathe I think they killin' me. I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies. I wake up stranglin', tangled in my bed sheets. I call the nurse 'cause it hurts to reminisce. How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss. Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here. 'Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care? Try to remember but it hurts. I'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt. I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward. There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours. ""Black Power!"" is what we scream. As we dream in a paranoid state. And our fate is a lifetime of hate. Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace. 'Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat. No more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped. And they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped. Mr. Police, please try to see. That there's a million motherfuckers stressin' just like me. That which does not kill me can only make me stronger. That's for real. And I don't see why everybody feel as though. That they gotta tell me how to live my life. You know? Let me live, baby, let me live. Pac, I feel ya, keep servin' it on the reala. For instance, say a playa-hatin' mark is out to kill ya. Would you be wrong for buckin' a nigga to the pavement? He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'. Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law. So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross. That's real, got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him. Sold a half a million tapes, now everybody want him.

Start climbin' up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown. That's why they ride the bandwagon. Still be draggin', sellin' lies. Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise.

J. Cole,Hip-Hop,4 Your Eyez Only,4 Your Eyez Only,2016.0,"Yeah (For your eyes). For your eyes only (For your eyes). For your eyes only, for your eyes only. (For your eyes, for your eyes). For your eyes only. Hey, niggas be dying on the daily. It seems my dreams faded for far too long. The consequences deadly. Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal. Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal. 'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off. Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause. Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black. Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack. And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me. Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet. Like I ain't out in the field like that. I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back. Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless. Screaming, ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless. That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic. To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven. This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic. I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets. But these felonies be making life the hardest. Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet. Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it. That's why I write this sonnet. If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break. Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it. (For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it. (For your eyes) For your eyes only. For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes, do you understand me? You probably grown now so this song'll hit you. If you hearing this, unfortunately means. That I'm no longer with you in the physical. Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive. He got me praying that the spiritual is real. So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too. So I know how part of you feels. Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me. Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me. I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots. And fiends that smoke rocks. I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot. I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance. Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance. Don't know if I ever had a chance. At a glance, I'm a failure. Addicted to pushing paraphernalia. But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once. Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years. My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted. So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging. Blood was staining the concrete. Older niggas I loved talked like they was above. Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money. Picked up the family business by the age of 13. Six years later was handed sentence. 'Round the same time is when you came in this world. Me and your mama thinking:. ""What the fuck we naming this girl?"". I told her ""Nina,"" the prettiest name that I could think of. For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19. Took me two felonies to see the trap. This crooked-ass system set for me. And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be. The one that set examples that was never set for me. I'm living fast, but not fast enough. 'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me. And if my past becomes the death of me. I hope you understand. It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count. Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout? Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated. 'Cause the cash running out? Niggas don't know how to act in a drought. See, baby girl, I realized. My definition of a real nigga was skewed. My views misshaped by new mixtapes. That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true. That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you. They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo. And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food. I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops. Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you. I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views. Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you. Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops. And the cyclical nature of doing time continues. My worst fear is one day that you come home from school. And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news. I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon. And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true. But maybe there's a chance that it's not. And this album remains locked. In a hard drive like valuable jewels. And I can teach you this in person. Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes. I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you. For your eyes, for your eyes only. One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling. What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling. I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing. But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice. And it was chilling, he said:. ""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children. I never asked for nothing, when times was hard. I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me. I dealt with the repercussions of my actions. I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit. But that shit was in my blood, you know my life. I know your momma, nigga, send my love. In case I never get a chance to speak again. I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib. That's the way I wished my family lived. But my granny crib was in the 'jects"". I had to interject like:. ""Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"". He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions. But I been having premonitions. Just call it visions from the other side. I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow. Like the time I'm living on is borrowed. With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father. Write my story down, and if I pass. Go play it for my daughter when she ready"". And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only. Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it. This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son. I dedicate these words to you and all the other children. Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation. That sent your pops to prison when he needed education. Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better. Although I know that means that I would never. Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled. When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro. With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old. Now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told. Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold. Not because he was the first. To get some pussy 12 years old. Not because he used to come through. In the Caddy on some vogues. Not because he went from bagging up. Them grams to serving O's. Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard. Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars. Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law"". Although that was true. Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you.",0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1

Weigh the situation how you want (right). The loving that you claim is just a four letter word. The third letter's inviting so visualize the verb. You curve thought waves when you're handling the candelabra. So you sitting on the baby grand. Transmitting like you're made of man. But you paint a funny face like a chick. When I see you I'ma tell you quick that uhh. I can't believe we built this large pizza pie together. No pepperoni. Yeah you wanted extra cheese, sometimes I gave you extras. How we divided slices like the Red Sea theory. I was Moses hopelessly scorned by your thorn zapora. Tried to bring that fairy-tale life, you wanted horror. But my microscope couldn't see or cope with that. I had to bolt from that, and left you dead in the sea. It's better for me, I'm satisfied with repping for D. We were certified hot, then dropped to lukewarm. Now we back up in the spot, claiming never been gone. Niggas who cut us off, wanna reattach us now. (Them girls who brushed us off, say they want some #'s to dial). Yeah I give that ass a number, and some lumber to pile. Now catch a curve from my kick (or show me loving by brick). So stick to the same plan, don't come shaking my hand. Like we peeps, it ain't beef but be sure to understand. Between us, it ain't all. You see them kids be scheming on what we done copped. Always out there scheming!. They steady fiending for the moment they can get us off the block. Why they always fiending? Your people might have your back, but you need to watch your front. Indeed, ain't nothing guaranteed. That's the truth! Things ain't goin' like you think they should. A lot say they wanna walk in my size 10's. Alright then; here's a pair. Lace 'em up tight then you might feel what was dealt to me. You see ain't no young boys up in here; keep a clear head. Trying to keep my pockets on stuffed, like deer heads. Upon the wall, so all the gall we get from y'all don't phase. So mind your biz and walk away. 'Cause I'm never gonna let you up inside my maze.",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

I've been in this game for years, it made me a animal. There's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual. A step-by-step booklet for you to get. Your game on track, not your wig pushed back. Rule Nombre Uno: never let no one know. How much dough you hold cause you know. The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially. If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up. Number 2: never let 'em know your next move. Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence? Take it from your highness. I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips. Number 3: never trust nobody. Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up. Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck. She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up. Number 4: I know you heard this before. ""Never get high on your own supply"". Number 5: never sell no crack where you rest at. I don't care if they want a ounce, tell 'em ""bounce!"". Number 6: that goddamn credit? forget it. You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!. 7: this rule is so underrated. Keep your family and business completely separated. Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch. Find yourself in serious shit. Number 8: never keep no weight on you!. Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too. Number 9 shoulda been Number 1 to me:. If you ain't gettin' bagged stay the fuck from police. If niggas think you snitchin' they ain't tryna to listen. They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'. Number 10: a strong word called ""consignment"". Strictly for live men, not for freshmen. If you ain't got the clientele, say ""hell no!"". Cause they gon' want they money rain sleet hail snow. Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up. If not, 24 years on the wake up. Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up.

Hank Williams,Country,I Saw the Light,Hank Williams Sings,1948.0,I wandered so aimless life filled with sin. I wouldn't let my dear savior in. Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night. Praise the Lord I saw the light. I saw the light I saw the light. No more darkness no more night. Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight. Just like a blind man I wandered along. Worries and fears I claimed for my own. Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight. I was a fool to wander and a-stray. Straight is the gate and narrow the way.

There is no part of my body that has not been used. Pity or pain, to show displeasure's shame. Everyone I've loved or hated always seems to leave. Don't hurt, just obey, lie down, do as they say.

Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men. Who reach for anything thay can to keep from going home. Standing in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter. Never glancing in the mirror at the people passin' by. And he stumbles as he's leavin' and he wonders if the reason. Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye.

The Sisters of Mercy,Rock,Nine While Nine,First and Last and Always,1985.0,And it's passing strange. And I'm waiting for the train. Caught up on this line again. And it's passing slowly. Killing time. But it's better than living in what will come. And I've still got some of your letters with me. And I Thought sometimes. Or I read too much. And I think you know. Let's drink to the dead lying under the water. And the cost of the blood on the driven snow. And the lipstick on my cigarettes. Frost upon the window pane. Nine while nine and I'm waiting. For the train... She said do you remember a time when angels. Do you remember a time when fear. In the days when I was stronger. In the days when you were here. She said when days had no beginning. While days had no end. When shadows grew no longer. I knew no other friend but you. Were wild. You were wild... Frost upon these cigarettes. Lipstick on the window pane. And I've lost all sense of the world outside. But I can't forget so I call your name. And I'm looking for a life for me. And I'm looking for a life for you. And I'm talking to myself again. And it's so damn cold it's just not true. And I'm walking. Through the rain. Trying to hold on. Waiting for the train. And I'm only looking. For what you want. But it's lonely here. And I think you knew. And I'm. And I'm waiting. And I wait in vain. For the train.. (repeat last verse x2).,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
Eminem,Hip-Hop,Bad Guy,The Marshall Mathers LP2,2013.0,"Part 1: Produced by S1 and M-Phazes. It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt. Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work. All it takes is one song on the radio, you're. Right back on it, reminding me all over again. How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt. Spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search. Maybe I needed to grow up a little first. Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt. But I'm coming for closure. Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed, for. The way that you turned your back on me. Just when I may have needed you most. Oh, you thought it was over? You could just close the. Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing? You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine. Well, I've never recovered. But tonight I bet you that what you're. 'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered. Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice. Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, ""Let it go, fuck this."". Heart's saying, ""I will, once I bury this bitch alive. Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset."". I flee the scene like it was my last ride. You see right through. Oh, you had me pegged the first time. You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify. What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy. I just hate to be the bad guy. (Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un). And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch. To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit. Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it? Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch!. Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit. Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!. You left our family in shambles. And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed? May be gone but he's not forgotten. And don't think 'cause he's been out the pictures. So long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to get ya. You're wrong and that shit was rotten. And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, cold. Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through? Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to? Not once you call to ask me how I'm doin'. Letters, you don't respond to 'em. Fuck it, I'm coming to see you. And, gee, who better to talk to than you? The cause of my problems. My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on you. Poof, then I'm gone, voosh. I've been drivin' around your side of this town. Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now. Finally I found your new address, park in your drive. Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life. And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva. My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house. See, it's sad it came to this point. Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment. To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy. I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy. It's revenge that I seek. So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window. Like I reached my full potential: I peeked. Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep. Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak. All the way 'round to the back porch. Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this. You don't plan for intruders beforehand? Surprised to see me? Cat caught your tongue? Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung. Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan. Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans. Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk? And here's your Bronco hat. You can have that shit back 'cause they suck. It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it. We're in the car right now wait, here comes my favorite lyric. ""I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"". And hey, here's a sequel to my. Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy. How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun!. Last album now, 'cause after this you'll be officially done. Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell. Bitch, I even have your initials. I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it. Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck. The best place you could be buried alive is right here. Two more exits, time is quite near. Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear. That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea, as cops appear in my driver's side mirror. (Oh, God! Police! Aaaghh!). Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least. New plan, Stan!. Slim: ""Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"". Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge. Ha ha, big bro, it's for you; Slim, this is for him. And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good. Now say you hate homos again!. Part 2: Produced by StreetRunner. I also represent. Anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend. I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in. I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen. Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin. Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in. When they say all of this is approachin' its end. But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again. Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds. Toilets clogged, yeah, 'cause I'm talking a lot of. Shit but I'm backing it all up. But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers. After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience. I'm the ringing in your ears. I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils. Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts. I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged. Grab for some water. But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow. I'm the bullies you hate that you became. With every faggot you slaughtered. Coming back on you, every woman you insult. Batter, but the double-standards you have. When it comes to your daughters. I represent everything you take for granted. 'Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona. Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic. Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone. 'Cause after all the glitz and the glam. No more fans that are calling your name. Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them. I'm the hindsight to say, ""I told you so!"". Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow. I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow. If you don't stop after they call ya. Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits. When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip. The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions. If there's anything you have left to say. 'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother. So 'fore you rest your case. Better make sure you're packin' a wallop. So, one last time, I'm back. Before it fades into black and it's all over. Behold the final chapter in a saga. Tryin' to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle. Twice, the magic that started. It all, tragic portrait of an artist. Tortured, trapped in his own drawings. Tap into thoughts blacker and darker. Than anything imaginable; here goes a wild stab in the dark. As we pick up where the last Mathers left off.",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1
David Bowie,Rock,Rock ‘n’ Roll Suicide,The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,1972.0,"Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth. You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette. The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget. Oh oh, oh, oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide. You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it. And the clock waits so patiently on your song. You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long. Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide. Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road. But the day breaks instead so you hurry home. Don't let the sun blast your shadow. Don't let the milk float ride your mind. You're so natural - religiously unkind. Oh no, love! You're not alone. You're watching yourself but you're too unfair. You got your head all tangled up. But if I could only make you care. No matter what or who you've been. No matter when or where you've seen. All the knives seem to lacerate your brain. I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain.

De La Soul,Hip-Hop,The Magic Number,3 Feet High and Rising,1989.0,"Three, that's the Magic Number. Yes, it is, it's the magic number. Somewhere in this hip-hop soul community. Was born three: Mase, Dove and me. And that's the magic number. (What does it all mean?). Difficult preaching is Posdnuos' pleasure. Pleasure and preaching starts in the heart. Something that stimulates the music in my measure. Measure in my music, raised in three parts. Casually see but don't do like the Soul. Cause seein' and doin' are actions for monkeys. Doin' hip hop hustle, no rock and roll. Unless your name's Brewster, cause Brewster's a Punk (three). Parents let go cause there's magic in the air. Criticising rap shows you're out of order. Stop look and listen to the phrase Fred Astaires. And don't get offended while Mase do-si-do's your daughter. A tri-camera rolls since our music's now set. Fly rhymes are stored on a Da.I.S.Y. production. It stands for ""Da Inner Sound, Y'all"" and y'all can bet. That the action's not a trick, but showing the function. Everybody wants to be a deejay. Everybody wants to be an emcee. But being speakers are the best. And you don't have to guess. De La Soul posse consists of three. This here piece of the pie. Is not dessert, but the course that we dine. And three out of every darn time. The effect is ""Mmmm"" when a daisy grows in your mind. Showing true position, this here piece is. Kissin' the part of the pie that's missin'. When that negative number fills up the cavity. Maybe you can subtract it. You can call it your lucky partner. Maybe you can call it your adjective. But odd as it may be. Without my 1 and 2 where would there be. My three: Mase, Pos and me. And that's the Magic Number. Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul. Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds. Common are speakers who honor the scroll. Scrolls written daily creates a new sound. Listeners listen cause this here is wisdom. Wisdom of a Speaker, a Dove and a Plug. Set aside a legal substance to feed 'em. For now get 'em high off this dialect drug. Time is a factor so it's time that counts. Count not the negative actions of one. Speakers of soul say it's time to shout. Three forms the soul to a positive sum. Dance to this fix and flex every muscle. Space can be filled if you rise like my lumber. Advance to the tune but don't do the hustle. Shake, rattle, roll to my Magic Number. Now you may try to subtract it. But it just won't go away. Three times one? (What is it?). (One, two, three!). And that's a Magic Number. (Yo, what's up?). (1, 2, 3). (I say, children, what does it all mean?). (Woah-woah-wo, 1, 2, 3). (I wouldn't lie to you). (No more no less, that's a magic number). (No more no less). (What it is?). (Do the shang-a-lang). (Anybody in the audience ever get hit by a car?).

Drake,Hip-Hop,From Time,Nothing Was the Same,2013.0,"What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up. With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love. You shouldn't have to deal with that. I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause. I love me, I love me enough for the both of us. That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us. So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of? Darling you, you give but you cannot take love. Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive. Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance. I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping. I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different. Started realizing a couple places I could take it. I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement. I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation. And influence a generation that's lacking in patience. I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience. Just me and my old man getting back to basics. We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted. When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing. Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas. We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us. We even talked about you and our couple of moments. He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups. You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone. Looking like you came from the 70's on your own. My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is. Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone? You don't even know what you want from love anymore. I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored. But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh? Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures. Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage. When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit. A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it. 'Cause that night I played her three songs. Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on. Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz. Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off. Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria. Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria. Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music. When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it. The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree. I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me. Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment? Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't. Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz. Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision. Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions. When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven. It seem like you don't want this love anymore. I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore. ""Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G. Been a East Side ting. Scarborough ting from time, G.

This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it. I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em. Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition. Fuck's the difference? I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules. Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose. I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full. I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me. Fuck you think? (Woo!). I got a couple of mansions. Still I don't have any manners. You got a couple of ghost writers. But to these kids it don't actually matter. They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"". I said, ""I don't have any answers."". 'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album.

""We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"". But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability. To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me. The inability to pen humility. Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of. Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em? Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular. Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up.

We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back. 'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage. All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap. I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad. But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat. That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that. But I think it's inevitable. They know what button to press or what lever to pull. To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch). And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger. But you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?). On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'. Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits.

Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin. It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram. And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again. Levels to this shit, I got an elevator. You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker. I sound like a broken record every time I break a record. Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater. Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way. I got spite inside my DNA. But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy. It's the moment y'all been waitin' for. Like California wishin' rain to pour. In that drought, y'all been prayin' for. My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw. Still the same Marshall, that outlaw.

I'm so glad you trusted me. To slide up on this dusty seat. And let your hair down. Get out of town. Got the stars coming out over my hood. And all I know now is it's going good. You got your hands up. You're rocking in my truck. You got the radio on. You're singing every song. I'm set on cruise control. I'm slowly losing hold. Of everything I got. You're looking so damn hot. And I don't know what road we're on. Or where we've been. From staring at you girl. All I know is I don't want this night to end. Going to cuss the morning when it comes. 'Cause I know that the rising sun. Ain't no good for me. 'Cause you'll have to leave. Going to make the most of every mile. Do anything to make your smile. Land on my lips. Get drunk on your kiss. Clock on the dash says 3:35. There's plenty of gas and the night's still alive. I don't want this night to end. No I don't want this night to end.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

Is in Zion! (Zion, Zion!). (Zion, uhh, Zion!). How beautiful if nothing more. Than to wait at Zion's door. I've never been in love like this before. Now let me pray to keep you from. The perils that will surely come. See life for you, my prince has just begun. And I thank you for choosing me. To come through unto life to be. A beautiful reflection of His grace.

If I asked him to talk about a fancy car, he'd be right on point. But we wanna talk about love. You can do it. (To another pupil) What do you think? You said you love somebody, you should know why you love them right? The way they act. Uh-huh. The way they carry themselves, stuff like that. Okay. The way that they hang with they boys, and they just stand out. It's like sometimes it don't even matter like what they wear or what they look like. It's like, that way, you know? Yeah. It's like you know you want to talk to him, because he stands out, it's like he got a glow or something. That's deep. That's what I'm talking about. I thought that was a beautiful point. Anyone else want to deal with that? It's sometimes, like when they try to act funny in front of they boys, like when they get around say they love you. They can't love you.

Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid. But the meanest thing that he ever did. Was before he left, he went and named me ""Sue."". Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke. And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk. It seems I had to fight my whole life through.. Some gal would giggle and I'd get red. And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head. I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue."". Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean. My fist got hard and my wits got keen. I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame. But I made a vow to the moon and stars. That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars. And kill that man who gave me that awful name. Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July. And I just hit town and my throat was dry. I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew. At an old saloon on a street of mud. There at a table, dealing stud. Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue."". Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad. From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had. And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye. He was big and bent and gray and old. And I looked at him and my blood ran cold. And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!. Now you're going to die!!"". Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes. And he went down, but to my surprise. He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear. But I busted a chair right across his teeth. And we crashed through the wall and into the street. Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer. I tell you, I've fought tougher men. But I really can't remember when. He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile. I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss. He went for his gun and I pulled mine first. He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile. And he said: ""Son, this world is rough. And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough. And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along. So I give ya that name and I said goodbye. I knew you'd have to get tough or die. And it's the name that helped to make you strong. He said: ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight. And I know you hate me, and you got the right.

Some are born and some are dying. It's alpha and omega's kingdom come. And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree. The virgins are all trimming their wicks. The whirlwind is in the thorn tree. It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks. Till Armageddon no salam, no shalom. Then the father hen will call his chickens home. The wise man will bow down before the throne. And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns. Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still. Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still. Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still. Listen to the words long written down. Hear the trumpets hear the pipers. In measured hundred weight and penny pound. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts.

I paid eighty dollars for this wedding ring. I couldn't take it off if I tried. And the cactus sure tastes strangely sweet. As it goes down inside. I dream I'm safe in my hotel womb. Soft and soul-made, it's a wonderful room. Sudden voltage in the night. With a rain forest girl. As we float downstream to the Amazon River. Where the black waters swirl. I say, why are you people wearing those masks? I say, can we be reconciled? She says the mother of the storm has to roam the sky. Searching for her child. I wish I'm back in my hotel womb. Slip through the crack to that wonderful room. Morning comes at last. And she's lying by my side. She's got the face of the widow who keeps following me. And the body of my bride.

Said, ""I'm your best friend and you know that's right. But your young bride isn't home tonight. Since you've been gone she's been seeing that Amos boy, Seth"". Now he got mad and he saw red. Andy said, ""Boy, don't you lose your head. Because to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself"". That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia.

So he went home and finally found the only thing. Daddy had left him and that was a gun. He went off to Andy's house. Slipping through the backwoods quiet as a mouse. Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make. He looked through the screen at the back porch door. And he saw Andy lying on the floor. In a puddle of blood and he started to shake. The Georgia patrol was making their rounds. So he fired a shot just to flag them down. A big bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said. ""Why'd you do it?"". The judge said guilty on a make-believe trial. Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile. Said supper's waiting at home and I got to get to it. Because the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands. Well, they hung my brother before I could say. The tracks he saw while on his way. To Andy's house and back that night were mine.

Friday night spotlight, and that was us. It might not have been you, but I can't judge. Just be proud of what makes you country. Does it run in your blood? Did it come from your daddy and mama? Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio? That feels so right. Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson? Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know. Me, I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church. Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt. Waiting for the fall to finally come along. So I can grab my gun and get my outside on. Might be from a city or a little farm town. Whatever kind of square that you drove around. Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down? You know you gotta let it out. I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve. Running bird dogs through them Georgia pines. It might not have been you, but I ain't judging. And just be proud of what makes you country. Whatever makes you country. You do your kind of country. They doing they kind of country. I do my kind of country. Whatever makes us country.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1
Damian Marley,Reggae,Pimpa’s Paradise,Welcome to Jamrock,2005.0,"And yes y'all, you now rockin with the best. Black Thought from the legendary Roots crew in the flesh. I slid up in here with the brothers from the Marley family, crestin, we 'gon set for y'all. Hey! She loves to party, have a good time. She looks so hearty, feeling fine. She loves to smoke, sometimes shifting coke. She's laughing when there ain't no joke, hey!!!. (Background Singers). (Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was now. (Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was. (Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was, now. Cause coke was a thing that once she first tried. Was once a blue moon to once a blue sky. And now she's wonderin who else wants to go buy. She don't got no money and wants to get high. Story sounds familiar like born to be wild. But she sillier, not quite the same but she similiar. A waste of a sarsaparilla. Used to look good in the videos now she look hideous. Now it's broken crack pipes with lipstick traces. Work the cold nights red district places. She seen more hotels then my tour suitcases. More male customers than Old Navy. She love limelight more than John Swayze. Seen more miles than a rental, Avis. She don't slow down then some day maybe. She lost then she can't find her way to safety. (Pimpa'ss paradise) That's all she was now. Check it out! She keep her head up in space like a satellite. Because she got a insatiable appetite. For stayin out late night with all the parasites. Plottin on the way to cop a little piece of paradise. Her dignity the only thing that she could sacrifice. Just get the monkey off her back and she be back in like. Five minutes, she stay on the move. She done smoked up the stone that the builder refused. All coked up, alone she ain't even in tuned. And it's sad cause she ain't really have a reason to use. She was a pretty girl cleaner than the board of health, studied and enjoyed herself. I don't know what drove her to avoid herself. Destroyed herself and took a taste of the yay. And now she on the track workin while she wastin away. It's safe to say she lookin for some place to stay. Whoever got a lil' paper to play could get a slice of this... (Background Singers). For no reason a seasoned spliff was the first thing. One spring season while she's out flirtin. Now she season me and don't need rehearsin. Esteem get a beatin', life is uncertain. Ego need feedin now no one's mercy. Beneath the demons she's a warm person. When she's not fiendin swearin and cursin. Behind the curtain she's really hurtin. And while her people don't even trust her at home. The dealer that bring and cook the rock down. And she without sinnin will spot the first stone. The feelin kicks in she's in the dark zone. Old friends walk pass goin bout there own. As if she is someone that they don't know. Then the King Of Kings lift her off the flo'. Sayin life is a thing when you learn you grow. She rise and fall like a star, her life write off like a car. Her face full of all kind of scar, always quick fi start a war. She can't keep herself up to par, she plays like a broken guitar. She always want take it to far. I doubt she ah go make it too far. She rise and fall like a star, her ride off like a car. Her face full of all kind of scar, always with fist start a war. Mi wonder if she make it so far, wuy!!! !.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

So I keep the engine running. She'll be my gasoline. She treats my heart like a stolen car. All the while she had the keys. Standing in the line of fire. I'll be right beside her.

(Ey, homie, what happened). My whole life flashed before my eyes, man. Life. Niggas used to come and get me. When it was time to disagree with an enemy. Pass the Hennessy it gives me energy. Packed the gat in the small of my back. Where these niggas at, I'll clear the whole pack. Talking shit cause I'm down for my set. I'm a vet, smoking on a wet cigarette. Who these niggas think they are. Wishing on a ghetto star, I represent my tar. I start busting and they scatter like water bugs. Cause these Westside niggas is harder thugs. Enslave us but nothing can save us from sporting Ben Davis. Shootin' at your neighbors. Cause sometimes I feel like a nut. Don't give a fuck when I open you up. Hot rocks. Fly from the back seat. And busta-ass niggas run like a track meet. And if you caught in the middle. Bleed more than a little (what). Killer King is the hospital. Feeling numb from the bullets I hum. And when they hit. Black mothers have fits. I don't give a shit. Fool I'm a vet you can bet. That I could dance underwater and not get wet. Check it. It's raining bullets and I'm still there. I'm still there. My house shoes get wet from the dew on the grass. Up early in the morning taking out the trash. Feeling like a loser, alcohol abuser. Two youngsters roll up on a beach cruiser. One on the peddles, the other on the handle bars. Tryna be ghetto stars. They said, ""are you from the Westside is it so?"". I said, ""hell yeah and who want to know?"". Me. In slow mo', .44 slugs, face down in the mud. Puddle full of blood. Left for dead, the pain starts to spread. Now I can't feel my legs. I meet Doctor Who at King Drew medical center. As I enter I.C.U. He said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital. I said I can't move my legs, he said don't try to. Now this ain't the end my friend but you'll probably never walk again. I sit there motionless holding this pain inside contemplating suicide. At night I jerk and jerk. But my dick don't work it don't even hurt. Now who'd ever thought a nigga rude as Ice Cube. A'be pissing through a tube. Fool I'm a vet. Fool, I'm a vet you can bet. I can dance underwater and not get wet (check it). Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair. Fuck a V-A they need G-A. Gang Hospital for a cripple. Now I'm drinking Ripple. Same corner, same hood I'm still there. With bandanas tied to my wheel chair. To all the hood rat hoes I'm fired. They mad cause my tongue get tired. Now everybody want to put they dope on me. Sayin I won't get searched by the LAPD. I'm sittin' in a doorway deuce-five. Depending on that to keep my ass alive. I don't got bows but my arm's about a one-six. With fucking legs looking like tooth picks. Some times I can't deal. Got to beg the BG's to roll me up the hill. Put me on the porch. Now I'm on the torch. Smoking cocaine. Just to maintain. Nothing to gain nothing to lose. And last night I couldn't make it to the bathroom. Feeling like a 2-year-old. You can't get a sip from the brew I hold. It's the only friend to a stranger. AKA: handicapped gangbanger. There's a lot in my life I regret becoming a ghetto vet. Fool I'm a Vet. Dedicated to all the ghetto vets. For every nigga that done took one for the hood.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

I want you to give me a call on area code 215-222-4209 and I'm calling in reference to the music business. Thank you."". Hey how ya doin'. Sorry ya can't get through. Why don't you leave your name and your number. And I'll get back to you. Hey how are ya doin'. But leave your name and your number. Once again it's another rap bandit. Fiending at I and I can't stand it. Wanna be down with the Day-Glo. Knocking on my door, saying, ""a yo yo"". ""I got a funky new tune with a fly banjo"". I can't understand what the problem is. I find it hard enough dealing with my own biz. How'd they get my name and number. Then I stop to think and wonder. Bout a plan, yo man I gotta step out town. You wanna call me up? Take my number down. It's 222-2222. I gotta answering machine that can talk to you. It goes. Yo, check it, exit the old style, enter's the new. But nothing's new 'bout being hawked by a crew. Or should I say flock cause around every block. There's Harry, Dick, and Tom, with a demo in his palm. Now I'm with helping those who want to help themselves. And flaunt a nut that's doggy as in dope. But it's not the mood to hear. The tales of limousines and pails. Of money they'll make like a pro. I be like, ""Yo black, just play me the tape"". But at the show the time to spare I just make. But the songs created in they shacks. Are so wick-wick-wack, situations like this. And now I hate they give me smiles Kool-Aid wide and ask. ""was it def?"". And with the straighest face I be like, ""hell yes."". I slip them the digits to Papa Prince Paul. So I don't go AWOL but yet I know when they call they get. Party at the dug-out on Diction Ave. Haven't been to the jam in quite a while. Figure I'll catch up on the latest styles. 'Stead piles and piles of demo tapes by the miles. All I wanna do is cut on the decks wild. But edition up here by the miles to the center. Reliever of duty, Plug One mosies in. And I be like, ""Yo G, Pos does all the producing"". Now woe is me to the third degree. Mase pulls the funny so I make like a bunny, jettin'. But I'm getting used to this demo abuse. Getting raped and giving birth to a tape. Cause there's no escape from the clutches of a hawker. Attached to my success, sent like a stalker. Make way to my radius playin' fly guy. Try to get on my back they force like Luke Sky. Me, Myself, and I go through this act daily. And rarely do I not. No matter how I dodge some jackal always nails me. No matter what the plot. And even out on tour they be like. ""Yo, I got a tape to play you back at the hotel"". I be like, ""oh swell"". Unveil the numeric code to dial my room. And tell them to call me at noon. But of course there's no answering machine in my room. But a pretty young adorer who I swung on tour. And if it rings while we're alone she'll answer the phone. And with the quickness she'll recite like a poem. ""Hey, you done did the right thing, dial up my ring ring. Now you're waiting on the beep. Say, I would love if you'd sing. The tune to Tru instead of fronting on the speak."". So no problemo, just play the demo and at the end it's break out time. Please oh please don't press rewind cause I'll just lay it down the line. POS:. Hey how ya doing. And we'll get back to you.. peace. 'Yo what's up man, this is Ronald Master down with the Fish Tank. Posse, man, you know man, so you know you can just hook. Me up, True. You know we got this fly new jam called 'Swimming In the. Fish Tank', you know we gonna rock it man, you know. What I'm saying, but I just need your help, Prince Paul gave me your.

Crossing the plain. I drew a bead on him. To practice my aim. My brother's rifle. Went off in my hand. A shot rang out. Across the land. The horse, he kept running. The rider was dead. I hung my head. I set off running. To wake from the dream. Went into the sheen. I kept on running. Into the south lands. That's where they found me. My head and my hands. The sheriff, he asked me. ""Why had I run?"". And then it came to me. Just what I had done. And all for no reason. Just one piece of lead. Here in the courthouse. The whole town was there. I see the judge. High up in his chair. ""Explain to the courtroom. What went through your mind. And we'll ask the jury. What verdict they find"". I felt the power. Of death over life. I orphaned his children. I widowed his wife. I begged their forgiveness. I wish I was dead. I hung my. I see the gallows. Up on the hill. And out in the distance. A trick of the brain. I see a lone rider.

And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes, and he knows that she knows. She runs back down the hallway, and through the bedroom door. She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer.

If only you could see just how lonely and how cold. And frostbit I've become. My back's against the wall. When push come to shove. I just stand up and scream: ""Fuck 'em all!"". Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in. This roof is cavin' in, up it's time to raise it, then. Your days are numbered like pages in. My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy. This crooked mind of mines got 'em all shook. And scared to look in my eyes. I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time. And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up. And butt-fucked this game up. Better be careful when you bring my name up. Fuck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim. But the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it. But I swear, one way or another. I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it. I swear to God, won't spare the rod. I'm a man of my words, so your fuckin' heads better nod. Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody. Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie. Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye. This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!. My head is swole. My confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal. I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk. You're trapped in my medicine ball. I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog. I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'.

Ziggy Marley,Reggae,Set Your Piggies Free,,,"There are times we choose to wear our shoes. Feet need to be protected. But when it's safe to go without, here's something unexpected. Those little piggies on your feet, they love to wiggle free, exploring nature, skin to earth, footloose and fancy wee-wee-wee-wee. All the way home. Set your piggies free. It's time to lose those socks and shoes and set your piggies free. Set your piggies free, exploring naturally. The greatest way to do it is to really get into it and set your piggies free. Take off your shoes. Feel the morning dew. Let the cool breeze blow in between each toe. Make a barefoot stand in the soft, warm sand. And don't forget to let your feet get wet. Watch out, little piggies. That water's cold. So set your piggies free. At times you're going to need a shoe. Your foot's just got to wear it. But when there's nature to explore, then you got to grin and ""bare"" it. Not that kind of bear feet. I'm talking bare feet. Set your piggies. I got to set my piggies. You got to do it. You know you got to do it.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

And just pull that shit out of you (Yo left). And get that motivation to not give up (Right, left, yo left). And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall. (Yo left, yo left, right, left). Flat on your face and collapse. 'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em. 'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em. 'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em. And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem. Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em? Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom. Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop. Amoxicillin's just not real enough. The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain. A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners. You're comin' with me, feel it or not. You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us. You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock. Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up? Fo' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up. You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck. 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out. 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps. I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse.

(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse. Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get. When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit. This is your moment, and every single minute you spend. Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again. So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can. And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end. 'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in. I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in. It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie. Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me. But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy. So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me. That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me. Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me. You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me. The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney Nate, hit me!. Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart. What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart. And it's absurd how people hang on every word. I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve. But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved. If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first. 'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse. That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse. My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict. I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers. But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles. The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers. So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em. The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static? 'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters. A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest, so. Until the roof (Until the roof).

They got they mind on they money, money on they mind. They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the 9. See, everyday they feel the struggle but stayin' on they grind. And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line. But I know there's a drop in the block. You move slow, you gettin' pressure from cops. You don't know whether or not to lay low.

I'ma tell you like Wu told me. Money, money, money, money. It drives the world crazy. Weezy, she used to be. And she used to be the sweetest girl!. She used to be the sweetest girl ever. Whatever, now she like sour amaretto. She wears a dress to the T like the letter. And if you make it rain she will be under the weather. She used to run track back in high school. Now she tricks on the track right by school. She take the loss 'cause she don't wanna see her child lose. So respect her, or pay up for the time used. And then she runs to the pastor. And he tells her there will be a new chapter. But she feels no different after. And then she ask him: ""Where my money at?"". Where my money at?

Please God walk with me. Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven. Back in elementary, I thrived on misery. Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed. Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest. Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest. Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past. You wanna last? Be the first to blast. Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased. Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets. Now he rest in peace. Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me. So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears. I suffered through the years. And shed so many tears. Lord, I lost so many peers. Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means. Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen. And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed. I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse. God, can you feel me? Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain. Show me some happiness again. I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well. I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail? My life is in denial and when I die. Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears. Lord, I suffered through the years. Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears. I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me. My every move is a calculated step. To bring me closer to embrace an early death. Now there's nothin' left. There was no mercy on the streets. I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin'. About to go to pieces, screamin' peace. And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it. I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free. They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame. Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game. No memories, just a misery. Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep. Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun? Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come. Lord! (God!). God, I lost so many peers. And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide. Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die. Wonder why as I walk by. Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high. This ain't the life for me, I wanna change. But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game. I'm trapped inside a maze. See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy. Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies. So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady. Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison. I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys. Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor.

It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes. Let's change the way we eat. Let's change the way we live. And let's change the way we treat each other. You see the old way wasn't workin'. So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive. And still I see no changes; can't a brother get a little peace? It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East. Instead of war on poverty. They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me. And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do. But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you. Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up. Crack you up and pimp-smack you up. You gotta learn to hold your own. They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone. But tell the cops they can't touch this. I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this. That's the sound of my tool. You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool. And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped. And I never get to lay back. 'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback. Some buck that I roughed up way back. Comin' back after all these years. ""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is.

Kenny Rogers,Country,The Gambler,The Gambler,1978.0,"On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere. I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep. So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness. 'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak. He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces. And knowin' what their cards were. By the way they held their eyes. So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces. For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice"". So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow. Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light. And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression. Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy. You gotta learn to play it right"". You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em. Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done. Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'. Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep. 'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser. And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep. And when he finished speakin'. He turned back towards the window. Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep. And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even. But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep. You got to know when to hold 'em (When to hold 'em). Know when to fold 'em (When to fold 'em).",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run. I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright. We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night. Tighter than a motherfucka with the gangsta beats. And we was balling on the motherfucking Compton streets. Peep, the shit got deep and it was on. Number 1 song after number 1 song. Long as my motherfucking pockets was fat. I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at. But she was hanging with a white bitch doing the shit she do. Sucking on his dick just to get a buck or two. And the few ends she got didn't mean nothing. Now she's suing cause the shit she be doing ain't shit. Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short. So now she's taking me to court. It's real conversation for your ass. So recognize, and pass to Daz. Now as I'm rolling with my nigga Dre and Eastwood. Fucking hoes, clocking dough, up to no good. We flip-flop and serve hoes like flapjacks. (Snoop: But we don't love them hoes) Bitch, and it's like that. This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow. You run up in them hoes and grab the cash. And get your dash on. While you're chilling with your homies and shit. And how my niggas kick the anthem like this. (Biatch). To the store, to get me a 4-0. Snoop Doggy-Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes. So I head down the street to Long Beach. Just so I could meet a freak. To lick me from my head to my feet. And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up. Nothing but homies around, so I puts my gun up. Bitches on my nuts like clothes. But I'm from Tha Pound and ""we don't love them hoes"". How could you trust a ho? (Snoop: Why?). Cause a ho's a trick. We don't love them tricks (Snoop: Why?). Cause a trick's a bitch. And my dick's constantly in her mouth. Turning them trick-ass hoes the fuck out now. I once had a bitch named Annie Mae. Used to be all in them guts like every day. The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung. I was in love like a motherfucka, licking the pearl tongue. The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good. But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood. So I figure niggas wouldn't trip with mine. Guess what? Got gaffled by one-time. I'm back to the motherfucking county jail. 6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail. I gets released on a hot sunny day. My nigga D.O.C. and my homie Dr. Dre. Scoop in a coupe, ""Snoop we got news. Your girl was tricking while you was draped in your county blues"". I ain't been out a second. And already gotta do some motherfucking chin-checkin'. Move up the block as we groove up the block. See my girl's house, ""Dre, pass the Glock"". Kick in the do', I look on the flo'. It's my little cousin Daz and he's fucking my ho, yo.

Cause I'm doin my own thing down with the swang. I'm hanging with Death Row like it ain't no thang. I say you know you can't deal, cause I'm a bitch that's real. Motherfuckers need to step back, hell yeah they need to chill. Because I don't give a fuck, and I don't give a fuck. And I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck. And now I gotta do some shit that's clean. But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean, hah. Like a washing machine I can wash the clothes. All the hoes knows that I'm on the flo', ho.

Now you decided to show me the same. No sweeping exits or offstage lines. Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind. I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie. I have my freedom, but I don't have much time. Faith has been broken, tears must be cried. Let's do some living after we die. Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day.",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

Dolly Parton,Country,Just Because I’m a Woman,Just Because I’m a Woman,1968.0,"I can see you're disappointed. By the way you look at me. And I'm sorry that I'm not. The woman you thought I'd be. Yes, I've made my mistakes. But listen and understand. My mistakes are no worse than yours. Just because I'm a woman. So when you look at me. Don't feel sorry for yourself. Just think of all the shame. You might have brought somebody else. Just let me tell you this. Then we'll both know where we stand. Now a man will take a good girl. And he'll ruin her reputation. But when he wants to marry. Well, that's a different situation. He'll just walk off and leave her. To do the best she can. While he looks for an angel. To wear his wedding band. Now I know that I'm no angel. If that's what you thought you'd found. I was just the victim of. A man that lets me down. No, my mistakes are no worse than yours.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1

Carrie Underwood,Country,Heartbeat,Storyteller,2015.0,"I love it when we're at a party in a downtown crowd, oh. But I can't hear you call me baby with the music up loud. Red wine, good times, no I don't mind being with everyone else. And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself. And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio. And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow. Saying everything without making a sound. A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon. Standing on your shoes in my bare feet. Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat. Oh whoa, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat. I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest. I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath. You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder. Baby, we won't need a song. We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss. What are we waiting on? Yeah, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat. Saying everything without making a sound, with the. River rolling in the background, underneath a harvest moon. We're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat, oh.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
Run-D.M.C.,Hip-Hop,King of Rock,King of Rock,1985.0,"I'm the king of rock, there is none higher. Sucker MCs should call me sire. To burn my kingdom, you must use fire. I won't stop rockin' till I retire. Now we rock the party and come correct. Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect. Got the right to vote and will elect. And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect. They called us and said we're gettin iller. There's no one chiller. It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller. As one def rapper, I know I can hang. I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang. Roll to the rock, rock to the roll. DMC stands for devastating mic control. You can't touch me with a ten foot pole. And I even made the devil sell me his soul. Now we crash through walls, cut through floors. Bust through ceilings and knock down doors. And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box. You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks. For every living person we're a verbal treat. It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat? Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool. I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule. It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool. It's all brand new, never ever old school. You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend. When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend. Music ain't nothin but a people's jam. It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band. Now I walked on ice and never fell. I spent my time in a plush hotel. I stood on many stages, held many mics. Take airplane flights, at huge heights. So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please. Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds. Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees. Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC. I am from, around the way. And Run goes to school, every day. And Jay plays the records he has to play. And we get down with no delay, HEY!. I rock the party with the words I speak. And Run says the rhymes that are unique. And Jay cuts the records every day of the week. And we are the crew that can never be beat. So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend. Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end. The rhymes we say, shall set a trend. Because a devestating rap is what we send. Every jam we play, we break two needles. There's three of us but we're not the Beatles. My name is Darryl, you can call him D. You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC. People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?"". D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean. Like we said before, we rock hardcore. I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can jaw. And now we got the knack, to attract. Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac. We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot. When it comes to rock, give it all we got. To be MC's, we got what it takes. Let the poppers pop and the breakers break. We're cool cool cats, it's like that. That's the way it is, so stay the hell back. We're causin hard times, for sucker MC's. Cause they don't make no songs like these. PERIOD!.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

I'm not half the man I used to be. There's a shadow hanging over me. Oh, yesterday came suddenly. Why she had to go. I don't know, she wouldn't say. I said something wrong. Now I long for yesterday.

The Sundays,Rock,Love,Blind,1992.0,"Picture myself as a thin white child. Back to the day I was born on. They slapped me into line as it crossed my mind. I've felt better. I've felt worse. This is my life and it's all very well. But never never never again, oh. As they say ""We've been robbed"". And don't you know that this time. Love, just love yourself like no one else. Love, it's enough. They can say what they like but they still can't take that. Distance myself from the things I'd like but. Everyone has something I need. Don't let me wake up & find. All those others leaving me behind. If you don't have a clue about life. Then I'm happy to say. Neither have I although. I'm not going to shrug my shoulders & suck my thumb. This time. Cos there's something I deserve. Picture my house in a postcard town. Picture a bomb in the sky. History at your door. Who could ask for more? So kill me with love. Just love yourself like no one else. Time's so scarce where I come from. Let them say what they like. Cos they still can't take your love.",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
Garth Brooks,Country,Mom,Man Against Machine,2014.0,"A little baby told God. Hey I'm kinda scared, don't really know if. I wanna go down there. Because from here it looks like a little blue ball. But that's a great big place and I'm so small. Why can't I just stay here with you? Did I make you mad, don't you want me, too?'. And God said, 'Oh child, of course I do. But there's somebody special that's waiting for you'. So hush now baby don't you cry. Cuz there's someone down there waiting who's only goal in life. Is making you sure you're always going to be alright. A loving angel tender tough and strong. It's almost time to go and meet your Mom. Now when she's talking to you. Make sure you listen close. Cause she's gonna teach everything you'll ever need to know. Like how to mind your manners to love and laugh and dream. And she'll put you on the path that'll bring you back to me. Come on child it's time to meet your Mom.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Alan Jackson,Country,The Older I Get,,2017.0,"The older I get. The more I think. You only get a minute, better live while you're in it. 'Cause it's gone in a blink. And the older I get. The truer it is. It's the people you love, not the money and stuff. That makes you rich. And if they found a fountain of youth. I wouldn't drink a drop and that's the truth. Funny how it feels I'm just getting to my best years yet. The fewer friends I have. But you don't need a lot when the ones that you got. Have always got your back. The better I am. At knowing when to give. And when to just not give a damn. And I don't mind all the lines. From all the times I've laughed and cried. Souvenirs and little signs of the life I've lived. The longer I pray. I don't know why, I guess that I. Got more to say. The more thankful I feel. For the life I've had, and all the life I'm living still.",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
