Nirvana,Rock,You Know You’re Right,Nirvana,2002.0,I will never bother you. I will never promise to. I will never follow you. Never speak a word again. I will crawl away for good. I will move away from here. You won't be afraid of fear. No thought was put into this. And always knew it would come to this. Things have never been so swell. I have never failed to fail. He-eee-eee-eeey. He-eee-eee-eey. He-eee-eee-ey. You know you're right. I'm so warm and calm inside. I no longer have to hide. Let's talk about someone else. Steaming soup against her mouth. Nothing really bothers her. She just wants to love himself. Always knew it'd come to this. (He-eee-eee-eey). You know your rights.,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
The Mission UK,Rock,Jade,Another Fall from Grace,2016.0,"She came as Lolita dressed as Venus. And adorned with Stars. With her deft allusion and a Universe between Us. She showed me her skill with words and I showed her my Scars. Don't mistake kindness for affection, she said. Don't ever let the attention go to your Head. No more let Death divide what Life can join Together. But just remember there is nothing that can last Forever. And Jade is Benediction. She is silent Prayer. And Jade is Exaltation. The colours that I wear. And Jade is Contradiction. She is naked but never bare. Jade is a Work, a work of Fiction. Nothing more than Castles in the Air. The shorter the leash the harder I will pull. My glass is Empty when once it was Full. I wish I could be Jesus and turn water into Wine. 'Cause all my grapes have withered, withered on the vine. With a smile like Mercury, elusive and fey. There's a Beauty in the night that can't be seen by day. She's a barbed wire Angel insatiable and cruel. She destroys my resistance like the most Dazzling Jewel. And Jade is Apostasy. Abandoned Faith and Hope. Jade is Hypocrisy. She is Kaleidoscope. And Jade is Precious Stone. Impervious and Rare. And Jade will never atone. For the Flowers in her Hair. And Jade never sleeps alone. There's always someone there. With Jade. To rest their Head on her thigh. To make her moist when she is dry. To hold the Breath of every sigh. To pledge their Life and how to Die. To kiss the sleep from her Eyes. To dry the Tears when she Cries. And Jade is all and Jade is None. And Jade is Moon and she is Sun. And Jade is You and Everyone. And she is Me and and all I've done. And Jade is Lost and she is Won. And Jade is the Bullet shot from your Gun .",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Pink Floyd,Rock,Hey You,The Wall,1979.0,"Hey you. Out there in the cold, getting lonely, getting old. Can you feel me? Standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fading smiles. Don't help them to bury the light. Don't give in without a fight. Out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone. Would you touch me? With your ear against the wall, waiting for someone to call out. Could you touch me? Would you help me to carry the stone? Open your heart, I'm coming home. But it was only fantasy. The wall was too high, as you can see. No matter how he tried, he could not break free. And the worms ate into his brain. Out there on the road, always doing what you're told. Can you help me? Out there beyond the wall, breaking bottles in the hall. Don't tell me there's no hope at all. Together we stand, divided we fall.

And I do appreciate you being 'round. Help me get my feet back on the ground. Won't you please, please help me? And now my life has changed in oh so many ways.

Struck a match to the underground, industry ignited. From metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth. Wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf. Scatting off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily. Tragically, that style deteriorate rapidly. Uncompleted missions, throwing your best known compositions. You couldn't add it up if you mastered addition. Where I come from, getting visuals is habitual. You're more safe walking on hot coals in rituals. I splash the paint on the wall, formed a mural.

Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage. Bitchass niggas counterfeit the funk. I smoke the bead of the skunk, tree top of the trunk. Moonshine drunken monk, your head get shrunk. Your treasure sunk, I be fucking bitches by the chunk. My name black, you worms wanna play in my dirt. Bitch stop, my Momma serve free lunch from the church. I cum like a thousand doves. Bitch you quiet at the bus, making no fuss, I got self love. Unglove the noose, watch a nigga transfuse. Dirty add to the fuse, heavy at the booze. I don't walk, I get carried.

Wu-Tang Incorp. take your brain on spacewarp. Talk strange like Bjork, great hero Jim Thorpe. How can I put it, life is like video footage. Hard to edit, directors, that never understood it. Too impulsive, my deadly corrosive dosage. Attack when you least notice through explosive postage. I don't play, the rap souffle saute for the day. Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig A Leg Leg Arm Head. Spread like plague, we drink Hennessy by the keg. I got the golden egg plus the goose. Eighty proof Absolut mixed with cranberry fruit juice. Ginseng root, I got your neck in a noose. Keep my money wrinkled, the rap star twinkle killer instinct. Sixteen bar nickel sell more copies than Kinko. Grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us. And we return like Jesus when the whole world need us. Is it appetite for destruction? Slap a murder rap on this production. I touch something, trust nothing. Iron Lung/Twisted Metal. I see 'em ducking my dart gun, busting from every angle. Worldwide total carnage, the sickest flow. That be codenamed Agent Orange, killing you slow. It's only right you pay homage. To those that's 'bout to blow like that shit up your nose. Solid as a rock when I strike target. Verbal be screaming on you like a drill sergeant. Herbals got me where I wanna be right now.

Comin' up like a fat rat. Big money, big cars, big bodyguards on his back. So it's difficult to get him. (But I got the hook up with somebody. Who knows how to get in contact with him). Hit him like this and like that. Let him know that I'm lookin' for a big fat dope sack. With ends to spend, so let's rush it. If you want to handle it tonight, we'll discuss it. On a nigga's time, and a nigga's place. Take my strap just in case one of his boys recognize my face. 'Cause he's a sheisty motherfucker. But I gives a fuck, 'cause I'm goin' Deep Cover. Yeah, and you don't stop. 'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop. Creep with me as I crawl through the hood. Maniac, lunatic, call him Snoop Eastwood. Kickin' dust as I bust, fuck peace. And the motherfuckin' punk police. You already know I gives a fuck about a cop. So why in the fuck would you think that it would stop? Plot, yeah, that's what we's about to do. Take yo ass on a mission with the boys in blue. Dre! (What up, Snoop?) Yo, I got the feelin'. Tonight's the night, like Betty Wright, and I'm chillin'. Killin', feelin' no remorse. Yeah, so let's go straight to the motherfuckin' source. And see what we can find. Crooked-ass cops that be gettin' niggas a gang of time. And now they wanna make a deal with me. Scoop me up and put me on they team and chill with me. And make my pockets bigger. They want to meet with me tonight. At seven o'clock (So, what's up, nigga?). What you wanna do? (What you wanna do?). I got the gauge, a Uzi, and my motherfuckin' twenty-two. So, if you wanna blast, nigga, we can buck 'em. If we stick 'em, then we struck 'em, so fuck 'em!. (""I can feel it!""). Six-fo'-five was the time on the clock. When me and my homie belled in the parkin' lot. The scene looked strange and it felt like a setup. (Better not be, 'cause if it is, they gettin' lit up!). Oh, here they come from the back in they 'llacs. I'm checkin' for the gats they strap, so what's up, black? (Chill, let's hear the deal. If it ain't up to what you feel, then grab your steel). Right, so, what you motherfuckers gonna come at me with? Hope you ain't wantin' none of my grip. 'Cause you can save that shit (Guess what they told me?). ""We give you 20 G's if you snitch on your homie. We'll put you in a home, and make your life plush. Oh yeah, but you got to sell dope for us."". Hmmm, let me think about it. Turned my back and grabbed my gat. And guess what I told him before I shot it. If you don't quit, yeah, if you don't stop, yeah. I'm lettin' my gat pop, 'cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop!.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

The Cure,Rock,Disintegration,Disintegration,1989.0,"Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery. The shameless kiss of vanity. The soft and the black and the velvety. Up tight against the side of me. And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed. And run in thickening streams of greed. As bit by bit it starts the need. To just let go my party piece. The aching kiss before I feed. The stench of a love for a younger meat. And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep. The holding up on bended knees. The addiction of duplicities. But I never said I would stay to the end. So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency. Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy. Screaming me over and over and over. I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery. Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery. Songs about happiness murmured in dreams. When we both of us knew how the ending would be. So it's all come back round to breaking apart again. Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again. Making it up behind my back again. Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again. Holding it up behind my head again. Cut in the deep to the heart of the bone again. Round and round and round and it's coming apart again. Over and over and over. And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces. I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone. I'm crying for sympathy, crocodiles cry. For the love of the crowd. And the three cheers from everyone. Dropping through sky. Through the glass of the roof. Through the roof of your mouth. Through the mouth of your eye. Through the eye of the needle. It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven. Than ever feel whole again. I knew I would leave you with babies and everything. Screaming like this in the hole of sincerity. Screaming it over and over and over. Stains on the carpet and stains on the memory.

Now you can debate, you c-c-c-concentrate. But you can't imitate D.M.C. the Great!. Dissin all devils, causin havoc in HELL. At a very high level base and treble shall YELL. Heard in the heavens are the sounds supreme. So clear to the ear it is sometimes seen. So loud like a cloud with thunder and LIGHTNING. So proud to the crowd it is somewhat FRIGHTENING. No calm in the storm like a beast unleashed. There's no stoppin' 'cause the rockin cannot cease; BREAK!. You see it's harder than hard, not one bit soft. Courageous and contagious so you better break North. Not a cold, on a roll, did you hear me cough? Just listen while I'm dissin cause you're pissin me off. Cold bedding is spreading all across your face. You can't take when I break and if that's the case. I'll go on, and on, and kick the bass. So back up off the cup while I take my taste. It's highly appraised when the hell is raised. So demanding and commanding that you all stand dazed. The unbelieving receiving prophecy so true. I cut the head off the Devil and I throw it at you. My mighty mic control, already brought his soul. The rock king is so bold when he rocks and roll. A black hat is my crown, symbolizin the sound. Signifyin, we won't play around; BUST IT!. Rappin and climbin beat-makin every day. No synthesizer sound, so silence when I say. I am great, get it straight, cause that's my fate. My name is Run I'm number one, that's how I rate. He's in the place with the bass, and style and grace. His name is Jay he's here to play, and win this race. He's off the wall, on the ball, his name is D. Kind of tall yes y'all, he's down with me. From the mountain valley to the deep blue sea. The word is heard as told by D. I don't sing I bring, much delight. Like a star shinin bright in the darkest night.

Kickin and tickin while you're havin a ball. Like chicken finger lickin I'll be vickin you all. So +Do The Bird, have you heard, did they give you a call. Just me and D.M.C., cold shakin the walls. There's no fearin when hearin sound of this kind. Across the land every man is goin out of his mind. On the face of the earth spreading like disease. Contaminating infiltrating like a horde of bees.

Falling deep in the drums so many of styles. Is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles. Cheating and now beating, the crowd I kept seating. But weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating. Styles that kept them full of bull. Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full. They got the nerve to cuss.

Eazy-E, a nigga that's real. Real niggas, straight off the streets of Compton. Quick to get in your shit without second thought. And if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught.

To the fact that this will bring an end to the negative. Flow to the sway cause I say fa-so-la-ti. At the top we will dwell. Difference is fame and we rise then we build. Where we are set we get fat and we swell. Motions of the Soul is a positive stride. One step forward is the space we consume. Vivid as the moon, you have yet to assume. How the Soul found the motto of a naughty noise called. Vocal is local so believe that. This chant sends L.I. on the strong map. Trying and live so you best realize. That the gift that I present, I say gift wrap. Style of the Tune is personal. And defining what's the rhyme is worst of all. Stop, sit and study cause the meaning isn't muddy. Just preach and do the gear as the first of all. Watch while the pitcher is pitching. Cause this is the pitch of the year. Sing a simple song but keep the swing strong. Though you heard Dove crying, I ain't fearing. Those who think De La's on the flip tip. Try to flip this and you're doomed. Watch for the B-B cause if you try to grieve me.

And for the shit that she does, give her a drum roll. Because the dumb bitch licks out the asshole. And she'll let you videotape her.

I wish I was in the bucket. To be the sixth nigga with the ho' and I can fuck it. So I told the bitch I was with that I'm goin' to the snack bar. And got the fuck out the car. Went to the bucket and I looked through the window. It was some niggas that I knew they let me in yo. And my turn was like next. I couldn't see her face, all I saw was her pussy and her chest. I wanted to see the face, I felt I oughtta. Peep over the seat, Oh shit! It's the preacher's daughter!. And she's only 14 and a ho'. But the bitch sucks dick like a specialized pro.

Cuz ninety percent of the bitches today they love that shit. And those are the main ones that say they don't do it. But MC Ren knows the bitches are used to it. So fellas, next time they try to tell a lie. That they never suck a dick, punch a bitch in the eye. And then the ho' will fall to the ground. Then you'll open up her mouth. Put your dick in and move the shit around. And she'll catch on and start doin' it on her own. Actin' like she's tryin' to suck the meat off a chicken bone. And then she won't let go.

That none of this means anything to me. And it's a long way back from seventeen. The whispers turn into a scream. And I... I'm not coming home. Save your breath, I'm nearly. Bored to death and fading fast. Life is too short to last long. Back on earth I'm broken. Lost and cold and fading fast. There's a stranger staring at the ceiling. Rescuing a tiger from a tree. The pictures in her head are always dreaming. Each of them means everything to me. I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down. I said I'm sorry I'm a bit of a let down. But all my friends are daring me to come over. So I come over and over and over. So let me buy you a drink. And we'll pretend that you think. That I'm the man of your dreams.

Spinning on that dizzy edge. Kissed her face and kissed her head. Dreamed of all the different ways I had to make her glow. ""Why are you so far away? "", she said. ""Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you? That I'm in love with you?"". You, soft and only. You, lost and lonely. You, strange as angels. Dancing in the deepest oceans. Twisting in the water. You're just like a dream. Daylight licked me into shape. I must have been asleep for days. And moving lips to breathe her name. I opened up my eyes. And found myself alone, alone. Alone above a raging sea. That stole the only girl I loved. And drowned her deep inside of me. You, just like heaven.",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

Got nowhere to go. Nowhere to run and hide. No matter how hard I try. Yeah, '03, I went from quite filthy to filthy rich. Man, their emotions change, so I can never trust a bitch. I tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit. Right in my face, so Game and Buck both can suck a dick. Now when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit. 'Cause I'm not writin' anymore, they not makin' hits. I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned. If money's evil, look at all the evil I done earned. I'm doin' what I'm supposed to, I'm a writer, I'm a fighter. Entrepreneur, fresh out the sewer, watch me maneuver. What's it to ya? The track I lace it, it's better than basic. This is my recovery, my comeback, kid. While you were sippin' your own Kool-Aid gettin' your buzz heavy. I was in the fucking shed, sharpening my machete. Sippin' on some of that revenge juice, getting my taste buds ready. To wolf down this spaghetti. Or should I say this spa-get-even? I think you fucking meatballs keep on just forgetting. Thought he was finished, motherfucker, it's only the beginning. He's buggin' again, he's straight thuggin', fuck who he's offending!. He'll rip your vocal chords out. And have them bitches plugged in the. Motherfucking wall with 3000 volts of electricity. Now take the other end of 'em. Then plug them motherfuckers-in-each one of your eye sockets. 'Cause I thought you might finally fucking see. That'll teach you to go voicin' your cocksuckin' opinion to me. I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit. Fuck letting up! You're gonna end up regretting. You ever betted against me. Feels like I'ma snap any minute, yeah, it's happenin' again. And I'm thinking about just saying. ""Motherfuck everybody that's up in this bitch but 50!"". 'Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go. I swear to God I put my heart and soul. In this more than anybody knows. I'm trapped, so all I do is rap. But everytime I rap I'm more trapped. And I rap myself right to this bubble, oh I guess it's bubble wrap. It's like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis. Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did? Feels like I'm going psycho again (shh, shh, shh, shh). And I might just blow my lid. Shit, I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid. 'Cause I'm runnin' in circles with. I haven't been this fuckin' confused since I was a kid. Sold like 40 million records, people forgot what I did. Maybe this is for me, maybe. Maybe I'm supposed to go crazy. Maybe I'll do it 3AM in the morning like Shady. Psycho killer, Michael Myers, I'm on fire like a lighter. Try to say this ain't classic, get yo' ass kicked mad quick. Wrap your head up in plastic. Pussy, now pick the casket, dirt nap with the maggots. It's tragic, it's sad it's never gonna end. Now we number one again. With that frown on your face and your heart full of hate.

De La Soul,Hip-Hop,I Am I Be,Buhloone Mindstate,1993.0,"I am Shortie. I be 4'11"". I am Posdnous. I be the new generation of slaves. Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes. The pile of revenue I create. But I guess I don't get a cut cuz my rent's a month late. Product of a North Carolina cat. Who scratched the back of a pretty woman named Hattie. Who departed life just a little too soon. And didn't see me grab the Plug Tune fame. As we go a little somethin' like this. Look ma, no protection. Now I got a daughter named Ayana Monet. And I can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough. So the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay. I am an early bird but the feathers are black. So the apples that I catch are usually all worms. But it's a must to decipher one's queen. From a worm who plays groupie and spread around the bad germ. I cherish the twilight. I maximize, my soul is the right size. I watch for the power to run out on the moon. (And that'll be sometime soon). Faker than a fist of kids. Speakin that they're black. When they're just niggas trying to be Greek. Or some tongues who lied. And said ""We'll be natives to the end"". Nowadays we don't even speak. I guess we got our own life to live. Or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule? Every now and then I step to the now. For now I see back then I might have acted like a fool. Now I won't apologize for it. This is not a bunch of Bradys. But a bunch of black man's pride. Yet I can safely say. I've never played a sister by touching where her private parts reside. I've always walked the right side of the road. If I wasn't making song I wouldn't be a thug selling drugs. But a man with a plan. And if I was a rug cleaner. Betcha Pos'd have the cleanest rugs I am. The Plug Two brand with the flavour. In the flute watch the sniffin'. So a sack of shows in demand. I read the diction from the second page. I got the one-two gauge. Baritone to the izm fan. Trees fall so I can play ground with my ink. So let me need ya to my ems go. I push the infinite and carry it. My carrier's the three over one. So my pluggins already know. Lick shots with moo. Catch the boo. From a ghost in the heckling crowd. If I give a foot. Jack Ville caught a spill. When a still came from my mouth. I brought a head down south. I don't check for the noose and the neck. So I never tell my ems. That finesse is knocking at my door. I choose to run from the rays of the burning sun. And dodge a needle washing up upon a sandy shore. I bring the element H with the 2. So ya owe me what's coming when I'm raining on your new parade. It's just mind over matter. And what matters is. That the mind isn't guided by the punished shade. I keep the walking on the right side. But I won't judge the next who handles walking on the wrong. Cuz that's how he wants to be. No difference, see. I wanna be like the name of this song I am. The deeds of a natural. Are seeds that are no longer planted. So the famine in the mind is strong. Tactics of another plane is now proven sane. Sane enough to let you know from within this song. I stabilize many cableized viewers. So my occupation's known. But not why I occupy. And that is to bring the peace. Not in the flower but the As-Salaam Alaikum in the third I am.",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'. If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit. It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame. It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same.
