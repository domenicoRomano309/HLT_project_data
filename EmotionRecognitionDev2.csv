We no play follow fashion, when we lead out. Now looky here, my big ideas. Gonna get me in trouble now amongst my peers. But have no fear, no bother cry tears. You're just miles ahead when I'm ahead light years. (Here.. here I come again). Gong originally, run fi the grand finale. (Have no fear.. for it is only I).

Gong to the Zilla, I'm the Don Die-Hearted. Anywhere me go, dem roll out red carpet. Some man a buy car and nah no house fi park it. Nah unify dem selfish like market. Dem sell out dem souls just to be rewarded. Bleach out dem skin, dem favour dead to rahtid. Soul too corrupt and dem blemish and faulted. Real Rastaman we cannot be outsmarted. Gong's not the one fi a bwoy take chance with. Ancient Nazarite weh make the Red Sea parted. Provide the harvest, in drought and shortage. With Jah by my side I've got all advantage. So buy your tickets to the show, get there early grab a seat. The real Gong is in the house, everything else counterfeit. If I have not been around, it's a part of my mystique. I've been busy so to speak, I've been winning on a streak. I've been feeling like a Wednesday, surrounded by the week. Be strong alone continue, fi di justice where we seek. So doh follow some DJ cah dem swimming up a creek. Dem inna deeper shit when time dem an dem maker meet. And if you buy the bullshit, then don't lose your receipt.

You think a silver spoon or like it drop inna mi lap. Me sign a billion autograph, up to now the tour no stop. Trade privacy for privilege, it balance when it swap. Tony Rebel say a reggae put Jamaica 'pon the map. Who am I to disagree when I've been reaping up the crop. My first release was '93, when dem a feed pon Similac. First Grammy at 23, tell me which one a dem do that. Another tour at 27, add it up and do the maths. The weight weh dem a carry that no heavy like me locks. I'm a veteran, the youngest to be exact. Ghetto people love me bad, I'm guessing opposites attract. Uptown me born and grow, Stony Hill to mark the spot. Big Gong to the Zilla and the return of the mac.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

You can be mine and I can be your buddy. The best buddy's in evening wear. Long lovin' lets Tru know (he's in there). I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee) word to the D. I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg. And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed. (Word). Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle. Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you. All I really wanna do is freak you (she freaked us). And I watched and then I checked my Swatch. To see the time. The Soul had formed a buddy line. And that buddy was (mine all mine). Now when Tribe, the Jungle, and De La Soul. Is at the clubs our ritual unfolds. Grab our bones and start swingin' our hands.

She get it so much we make bets on who the ho would love to go through. And for the shit that she does, give her a drum roll. Because the dumb bitch licks out the asshole. And she'll let you videotape her. And if you got a gang of niggas, the bitch would let you rape her. She likes suckin' on dicks, and lickin' up nut. And they even take the broomstick up the butt. Just to say that she did it with a rapper. But the pussy was more fishy than red snapper. ""But how many licks would it take,"" she asks. ""To make MC Ren start gooshin' up vanilla shakes?"". She took her tongue out her mouth, put it on top. Like a cherry, started movin' it like a snake and it was very irresistable. I couldn't pay the bitch to quit.

I thought they wuz commin' to start trouble but no. Five niggas in the bucket with the neighborhood ho'. Now what do you expect they're gonna dogg her like a doggy. Thirty minutes later and the windowz all were foggy. And I'm off in my car havin' a fit cuz the bitch that I'm with. Said no fuckin' on the first date, shit. And I'm like Damn! I wish I was in the bucket. To be the sixth nigga with the ho' and I can fuck it. So I told the bitch I was with that I'm goin' to the snack bar. And got the fuck out the car. Went to the bucket and I looked through the window. It was some niggas that I knew they let me in yo. And my turn was like next. I couldn't see her face, all I saw was her pussy and her chest. I wanted to see the face, I felt I oughtta. Peep over the seat, Oh shit! It's the preacher's daughter!. And she's only 14 and a ho'. But the bitch sucks dick like a specialized pro. She looked at me, I was surprised. But wasn't passin' up the chance of my dick gettin' baptized. I told the bitch to do it quick. You little ho' hurry up and suck my dick!. Now I'm a break it down with a fact. Since the last ""Just don't bite it"" girls don't know how to act. Sayin' that they never would suck a dick. But when they've tried it they couldn't quit. Cuz ninety percent of the bitches today they love that shit. And those are the main ones that say they don't do it. But MC Ren knows the bitches are used to it. So fellas, next time they try to tell a lie. That they never suck a dick, punch a bitch in the eye. And then the ho' will fall to the ground. Then you'll open up her mouth. Put your dick in and move the shit around. And she'll catch on and start doin' it on her own. Actin' like she's tryin' to suck the meat off a chicken bone. And then she won't let go. Because bitches suck nut out of a dick just like Drano. Get the last drop, unclogging the pipe. Then the stupid bitch is out doing that same shit the next night. Because she just can't quit.

None other has ever known. He speaks and the sound of his voice is so sweet. The birds hush their singing. And the melody that he gave to me. Within my heart is ringing.

Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary. The ringing of the division bell had begun. Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway. Do they still meet there by the Cut. There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps. Running before time took our dreams away. Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground. To a life consumed by slow decay. The grass was greener. The light was brighter. With friends surrounded. The nights of wonder. Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us. To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side. Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again. Dragged by the force of some inner tide. At a higher altitude with flag unfurled. We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world. Encumbered forever by desire and ambition. There's a hunger still unsatisfied. Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon. Though down this road we've been so many times. The taste was sweeter. The dawn mist glowing. The water flowing. The endless river. For ever and ever. ""Is that Charlie? Hello Charlie!.

He said, ""Come on you dirty hack into that district court"". Into the courtroom, my trial began. Where I was handled by twelve honest men. Just before the jury started out. I saw that little judge commence to look about. In about five minutes, in walked the man. Holding the verdict in his right hand. The verdict read, in the first degree. I hollered, ""Lawdy, Lawdy, have mercy on me"". The judge he smiled as he picked up his pin. Ninety-nine years in the Folsom Pen. Ninety-nine years underneath that ground.

Is one of the main reasons I don't give a fuck. Chances are usually not good. 'Cause I'm frisked with my hands on a hot hood. And gettin' jacked by the you-know-who. When in a black and white the capacity is two. We're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers. Not wearing medallions, 'cause we're not stupid, mutherfuckers. They're out to take our heads for what we said in the past. Point blank, they can kiss my black ass. I didn't stutter when I said ""Fuck Tha Police"". 'Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace. Now it's broken and can't be fixed. 'Cause police and little black niggas don't mix so. Now I'm creepin' through the fall. Runnin' like a G, we'll see, I might have slayed y'all.

They got everybody singin' my ""Fuck Tha Police"" song. And while they treat my group like dirt. Their whole fuckin' family is wearin' our T-shirts. So I'mma run 'til I can't run no more. 'Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score. I got a urge to kick down doors. At my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls. Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'. Dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'. Started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it. So now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it. The number's even - now I'm leavin'. We're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in. Her and the troops are right behind me. But they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me. One more mile to go through the dark streets.

And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe. I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight. As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight. High off her love, drunk from her hate. It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate. And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates.

Pushing her white face into the mirror. Aching inside me and turn me 'round. Just like the old days. Caressing an old man and painting a lifeless face. Just a piece of new meat in a clean room. The soldiers close in under a yellow moon. All shadows and deliverance under a black flag. A hundred years of blood, crimson. The ribbon tightens round my throat.

Nigga, I toast ya, put fear in your heart. Fuck up the party before it even start. Pissy drunk, off the Henny and skunk. On some Brand Nubian shit beating down punks. Bitches in the back looking righteous. In a tight dress, I think I might just. Hit her with a little Biggie 101, how to tote a gun. And have fun with Jamaican rum. Conversation, blunts in rotation. My man Big Jock got the Glock in his waist and. We're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking. If money smell bad, then this nigga Biggie stinking. Is it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm. She grabbed my arm and said ""Let's leave calm"". I'm hitting skins again. Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken. Niggas start to loc out, a kid got choked out. Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out. (Music stops. Indecipherable sounds of people yelling and arguing. Biggie breaks it up yelling ""Yo, chill, man, chill!""). Can't we just all get along? So I can put hickies on her chest like Little Shawn. Get her pissy drunk off of Dom Perignon. And it's on, and I'm gone. That's that. Party and bullshit, and party . Junior M.A.F.I.A. like to. Uptown likes to. Bad Boy likes to. Brooklyn Crew likes to. 3rd Eye likes to. Mo Bee likes to.

Out the vagina. Out the vagina, it all comes sliding. No, no you're not alone. Cause everybody bleeds. From time to time. So let it flow. Friendships fall apart. And leave a shameful stain.

Not feeling any pain at closing time. But tonight your memory found me much too sober. Couldn't drink enough to keep you off my mind. Tonight the bottle let me down. And let your memory come around. The one true friend I thought I'd found. I've always had a bottle I could turn to. And lately I've been turning every day. But the wine don't take effect the way it used to.

George Strait,Country,Every Little Honky Tonk Bar,Honky Tonk Time Machine,2019.0,"Every Little Honky Tonk Bar. Whiskey is the gasoline that lights the fire that burns the bridge. Ice creates the water that's no longer runnin' under it. Stool holds the fool that pours the whiskey on his broken heart. Cigarettes create the smoke that hides the lonesome in his eyes. The jukebox plays Hank, ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"". Dance floor holds the folks trying to forget who they are. And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar. Friday night, it's a given. I'll be L-I-V-N, livin'. We'll dance on the bar 'til we're sleeping it off in the car. Monday morning, it's a given. I'll be D-R-A-G-N, draggin'. Neon lights flashing bright 'til you're almost hypnotized. Waitress, short skirt, gets hit on by every guy. Comin' and goin', always rollin' with the flow. Bartender, pour our drinks; Codigo, do a shot. You think you're tall and bulletproof. Until somebody says you're not. You step outside thinkin' you're gonna show 'em you are.

John Denver,Country,Back Home Again,Back Home Again,1974.0,"Back Home Again. There's a storm across the valley. Clouds are rolling in. The afternoon is heavy. On your shoulders. There's a truck out on the four lane. A mile or more away. And the whining of his wheels. Just makes it colder. He's an hour away from riding. On your prayers up in the sky. And ten days on the road. Are barely gone. There's a fire softly burning. Supper's on the stove. It's the light in your eyes. That makes him warm. Hey, it's good to be back home again. Sometimes this old farm. Feels like a long lost friend. Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again. There's all the news to tell him. How'd you spend your time. What's the latest thing the neighbors say. And your mother called last Friday. Sunshine made her cry. You felt the baby move just yesterday. Hey, it's good to be back home again, yes it is. And all the time that I can lay this tired, old body down. To feel your fingers feather soft upon me. The kisses that I live for. The love that lights my way. The happiness that living with you brings me. It's the sweetest thing I know of. Just spending time with you. It's the little things that make a house a home. Like a fire softly burning, supper's on the stove. The light in your eyes that makes me warm. Hey, it's good to be back home again, oh it is. I said hey, it's good to be back home again.",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
Eminem,Hip-Hop,Stan,The Marshall Mathers LP,2000.0,"Stan. My tea's gone cold. I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window. And I can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad. Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'. I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom. I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em. There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'. Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em. But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter? My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father. If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? I'ma name her Bonnie. I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry. I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him. I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan. I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam. I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man. I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat. Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back. Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan. Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance. I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans. If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to. But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew. That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old. We waited in the blisterin' cold. For you, for four hours, and you just said no. That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol. He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do. I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to. Remember when we met in Denver? You said if I'd write you, you would write back. See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither. He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her. I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs. So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on. 'Cause I don't really got shit else. So that shit helps when I'm depressed. I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest. Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds. It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me. See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it. My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7. But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does. She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up. You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose. Sincerely yours, StanP.S. : We should be together too. Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans. This'll be the last package I ever send your ass. It's been six months, and still no wordI don't deserve it? I know you got my last two letters. I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect. So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it. I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway. Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive? You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night"". About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'. But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him? That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'. Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers nowI'm drowsy. And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call. I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall. I loved you, Slim, we coulda been togetherthink about it!. You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it. And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it. I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me. See, Slimshut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk. Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk. But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her upSee? I ain't like you. 'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too. Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now. Oh, shit, I forgothow am I supposed to send this shit out?!. Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy. You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she? Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that. And here's an autograph. For your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap. I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you. Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you. But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too? I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you? You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'. To help your ass from bouncin'. Off the walls when you get down some. And what's this shit about us meant to be together? That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other. I really think you and your girlfriend need each other. Or maybe you just need to treat her better. I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time. Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine. If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan. Why are you so mad? Try to understand. That I do want you as a fan. I just don't want you to do some crazy shit. I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick. Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge. And had his girlfriend in the trunk. And she was pregnant with his kid. And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to. Come to think about it, his name wasit was you, damn.",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

So you left me with lies. Let the banners unfold. Let them fall to the floor. We once had each other. But now we're not so sure. Are we living in the past? Where there's nothing left to fear. Won't you say that you love me? Tell me what I want to hear. A cold war for the mind. My distant colours still bleeding. A broken promise for the soul. Never loving never healing.

Nickelback,Rock,After the Rain,Feed the Machine,2017.0,"After the Rain. All your life, scramble and scurry. Take your time, rather than hurry. Never too late to write the best of your story. Remember to breathe or else you're gonna be sorry. Life's no race, it's a companion. Always face with reckless abandon. The ticket to life as my mother once told me. Stick with your pride and you're gonna be lonely (gonna be lonely). Everybody says that life takes patience. But nobody wants to wait. Everybody says we need salvation. But nobody wants to be saved. The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train. The blue skies we wait on. Are gonna have to come after the rain. Spend your days happy and grateful. Avoid the taste of wanting and wasteful. Every good thing will come in moderation. Envy and greed will only lead to frustration. Choose your friends, carefree and kindly. Choose your words, careful and wisely. Always be there to lend a comforting shoulder. One will be there to share a day when you're older (a day when you're older). All mistakes, committed upon us. Always take a toll on the conscience. Every regret is a debt that you live with. Never forget to remember forgiveness. Are gonna have to come after the rain (ra-ai-ai-ain). Gonna have to come after the rain (ra-ai-ai-ain). Rain, yeah.
