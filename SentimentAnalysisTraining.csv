The Sweetest Thing,"The Sweetest Thing. The unexpected. Multi-dimensional. Unexpected sound of the Refugee All-Stars. The sweetest thing I've ever known. Was like the kiss on the collarbone. Soft caress of happiness. The way you walk, your style of dress. I wish I didn't get so weak. Ooo, baby, just to hear you speak. Makes me argue just to see. How much you're in love with me. See like the queen upon her throne. It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I've known. I get mad when you walk away (don't walk away). So I tell you leave, when I mean stay. Warm as the sun dipped in black. Fingertips on the small of my back. More valuable than all I own. Like your precious, precious, precious, precious, precious, baby, dark skin tone. It was the...Ah. I tried to explain. Ah...but baby, it's in vain. Speaking on my mother's phone. The touching makes me think I'm grown, (you ain't grown). Sweet prince of the ghetto. Your kisses taste like armaretto.

Everyday Struggle,"Everyday Struggle. I don't wanna live no more. Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door. I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle. Another day, another struggle (Right). I know how it feel to wake up fucked up. Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell. People look at you like you's the user. Sellin' drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser. But they don't know about your stress-filled day. Baby on the way, mad bills to pay. That's why you drink Tanqueray, so you can reminisce. And wish you wasn't livin' so devilish, shit. I remember I was just like you. Smokin' blunts with my crew, flippin' over 62's. 'Cause G-E-D wasn't B-I-G. I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me. She was forced to kick me out, no doubt. Then I figured out nicks went for 20s down South. Packed up my tools for my raw power move. Glock 19 for casket and flower moves. For chumps tryin' to stop my flow. And what they don't know will show on the autopsy. Went to see Papi to cop me a brick. Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it. Smokin' mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court. For an assault that I caught in Bridgeport, New York. Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man. You better have your gat in hand, 'cause man. I had the master plan, I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland. With my man Two-TECs to take over this projects. They call him Two-TECs, he tote two TECs. And when he start to bust, he like to ask, ""Who's next?"". I got my honey on the Amtrak with the crack. In the crack of her ass, two pounds of hash in the stash. I wait for hon to make some quick cash. I told her she could be lieutenant, bitch got gassed. At last, I'm literally loungin', black. Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks. Had to re-up, see what's up with my peeps. Toyota deal-athon had it cheap on the Jeeps. See who got smoked, what rumors was spread. Last I heard I was dead, with six to the head. Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder. We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter. Heard TEC got murdered in a town I never heard of. By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners. And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch. I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich. Conspiracy, she'll be home in three. Until then I looks out for the whole family. A true G, that's me, blowin' like a bubble. In the everyday struggle. I'm seein' body after body and our mayor Giuliani. Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti. My daughter use a potty so she's older now. Educated street knowledge, I'ma mold her now. Trick a little dough buyin' young girls fringes. Dealin' with the dope fiend binges, seein' syringes. In the veins, hard to explain how I maintain. The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange. Breakin' days on the set, no sweat. Drunk off Moet, can't bag yet because it's still wet. But when that dry, baggin' five at a time. I can clock about nine on the check cashin' line. I had the first and the third, rehearse, that's my word. Thick in the game, D's knew my first name. Should I quit? Shit no, even though they had me scared. Yo, they got a eight, I got a TEC with air holes. And that's just how the shit go in the struggle, motherfucker. Hah, come on, what you say? Junior M.A.F.I.A. right. Yeah, rock on, woo!.

Have a good time and be gone. But I fell in love with a lady. Now I sing a mountain song. I listened to the music. Of the night wind in the pines. I saw the quiet slendour. Of a field of columbine. I skied on crystal pathways. To a mountain peak so tall. And I walked the mighty summits. With the one who made it all. And I fell in love with a lady. 'Cause I've seen her at her best. And I've walked her wild and rugged paths. Through her open wilderness. And now I never can betray her. Steal her riches and be gone. 'Cause when you love a mountain lady. You're gonna sing a mountain song. Now people come from everywhere. To see what they can find. And some take lots of pictures. And some just take their time. But they're some who take her beauty.

Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me. For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways. Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated. When I blew, see, but it was confusing.

He didn't pour me a beer. His blue eyes kind of went misty. He said: ""You can't find that here. Because it's the first long kiss on a second date. Momma's all worried when you get home late. And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate. Because your hands are shaking so much. And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair. Eating burnt suppers the whole first year. And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up. Yeah, man, that's the good stuff"". He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass. And I smiled and said: ""I'll have some of that"". We sat there and talked as an hour passed. Like old friends. I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare. It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair. He said: ""That's my Bonnie. Taken about a year after we were wed"". He said ""Spent five years in the bottle. When the cancer took her from me. But I've been sober three years now. Because the one thing stronger than the whiskey. Was the sight of her holding my baby girl. The way she adored that string of pearls. I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl. Married his high school love. And it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'. Being right there as our time got small. And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up. He said: ""When you get home, she'll start to cry. When she says: 'I'm sorry,' say: 'So am I'. And look into those eyes, so deep in love. And drink it up. Because that's the good stuff.

And didn't see me grab the Plug Tune fame. As we go a little somethin' like this. Look ma, no protection. Now I got a daughter named Ayana Monet. And I can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough.

Nowadays we don't even speak. I guess we got our own life to live. Or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule? Every now and then I step to the now. For now I see back then I might have acted like a fool. Now I won't apologize for it. This is not a bunch of Bradys. But a bunch of black man's pride. Yet I can safely say. I've never played a sister by touching where her private parts reside. I've always walked the right side of the road. If I wasn't making song I wouldn't be a thug selling drugs. But a man with a plan. And if I was a rug cleaner. Betcha Pos'd have the cleanest rugs I am. The Plug Two brand with the flavour. In the flute watch the sniffin'. So a sack of shows in demand.

I choose to run from the rays of the burning sun. And dodge a needle washing up upon a sandy shore. I bring the element H with the 2. So ya owe me what's coming when I'm raining on your new parade. It's just mind over matter. And what matters is. That the mind isn't guided by the punished shade. I keep the walking on the right side. But I won't judge the next who handles walking on the wrong. Cuz that's how he wants to be. No difference, see. I wanna be like the name of this song I am. The deeds of a natural. Are seeds that are no longer planted. So the famine in the mind is strong. Tactics of another plane is now proven sane. Sane enough to let you know from within this song. I stabilize many cableized viewers. So my occupation's known. But not why I occupy.

She once believed in every story he had to tell. One day she stiffened, took the other side. Empty stares from each corner of a shared prison cell. One just escapes, one's left inside the well. And he who forgets will be destined to remember... Oh oh ohh. Ooh, she don't want him (she don't want him). Oh, She won't feed him after he's flown away. Oh, into the sun. Ah, into the sun.

The River,"The River. You know a dream is like a river. Ever changin' as it flows. And a dreamer's just a vessel. That must follow where it goes. Trying to learn from what's behind you. And never knowing what's in store. Makes each day a constant battle. Just to stay between the shores. And I will sail my vessel. 'Til the river runs dry. Like a bird upon the wind. These waters are my sky. I'll never reach my destination. If I never try. So, I will sail my vessel. Too many times we stand aside. And let the waters slip away. Till what we put off till tomorrow. Has now become today. So don't you sit upon the shoreline. And say you're satisfied. Choose to chance the rapids. And dare to dance the tide. Yes, I will sail my vessel. And there's bound to be rough waters. And I know I'll take some falls. But with the good Lord as my captain. I can make it through them all.",Garth Brooks,Country,Ropin’ the Wind,1992.0,negative

This time the Magic Number is two. Cause it takes two, not three, to seduce. My destiny of love is brought to an apex. Sex is a mere molecule. In this world of love that I have for you. It's true. Now it's time to let this rhyme style. Get somewhat poured in the mold. Hold my hand and we'll pick my plantation. Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul. Life will begin at the cut of a rim. Take it as filled to the rim as in brim. Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop. We'll make Campbell's Alphabet Soup. And spell Plug One's within. Forward march is the say. When transistors will play. Come into bed is the mood. Dolby sound will be then top crowned. When I put the needle into your groove. I got a good thing. And in full swing. I show this in gifts, words or letters. But even without those three. Eye know you'll be close to me cause. It's I again and the soul that I send. Is taking steps to reach your heart. Any moment you feel alone. I can fill up your empty part. We can ascend 'till we reach De La Heaven. And in a spin we'll hit the Top Ten. Then we will meet Mr Stuckie. And Pos' brother Lucky will preach. Let the wedding begin. Shot by an arrow of cupid. Through the string of a G-clef. My dear, I claim you're def. And if you can hear me, by golly gee. Trugoy is ready for what you posess. We could live in my Plug Two home. And on Mars where we could be all alone. And we make a song for two. Picture perfect things and I sing of how.",De La Soul,Hip-Hop,3 Feet High and Rising,1989.0,positive

And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes, and he knows that she knows. She runs back down the hallway, and through the bedroom door. She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer.

Raising Hell,"Raising Hell. Kings from Queens from Queens come Kings. We're raisin hell like a class when the lunchbell rings. The king will be praised, and hell will be raised. S-s-s-suckers try to faze him but D won't be fazed. So what's your name? D.M.C.! The King is me!. Your High-ness, or His Majesty!. Now you can debate, you c-c-c-concentrate. But you can't imitate D.M.C. the Great!. Dissin all devils, causin havoc in HELL. At a very high level base and treble shall YELL. Heard in the heavens are the sounds supreme. So clear to the ear it is sometimes seen. So loud like a cloud with thunder and LIGHTNING. So proud to the crowd it is somewhat FRIGHTENING. No calm in the storm like a beast unleashed. There's no stoppin' 'cause the rockin cannot cease; BREAK!. You see it's harder than hard, not one bit soft. Courageous and contagious so you better break North. Not a cold, on a roll, did you hear me cough? Just listen while I'm dissin cause you're pissin me off. Cold bedding is spreading all across your face. You can't take when I break and if that's the case. I'll go on, and on, and kick the bass. So back up off the cup while I take my taste. It's highly appraised when the hell is raised. So demanding and commanding that you all stand dazed. The unbelieving receiving prophecy so true. I cut the head off the Devil and I throw it at you. My mighty mic control, already brought his soul. The rock king is so bold when he rocks and roll. A black hat is my crown, symbolizin the sound. Signifyin, we won't play around; BUST IT!. Rappin and climbin beat-makin every day. No synthesizer sound, so silence when I say. I am great, get it straight, cause that's my fate. My name is Run I'm number one, that's how I rate. He's in the place with the bass, and style and grace. His name is Jay he's here to play, and win this race. He's off the wall, on the ball, his name is D. Kind of tall yes y'all, he's down with me. From the mountain valley to the deep blue sea. The word is heard as told by D. I don't sing I bring, much delight. Like a star shinin bright in the darkest night. If you are cold, I'll bring you heat. Like I brought the whole world my funky beat. Mysterious and serious I ain't no joke. Fire from the depths of hell AND YOU CAN SMELL THE SMOKE!. Kickin and tickin while you're havin a ball. Like chicken finger lickin I'll be vickin you all. So +Do The Bird, have you heard, did they give you a call. Just me and D.M.C., cold shakin the walls. There's no fearin when hearin sound of this kind. Across the land every man is goin out of his mind. On the face of the earth spreading like disease. Contaminating infiltrating like a horde of bees. Lord of lyrics, duke of discussion. Ruler of rock, and king at cold-crushin. Puller of people - controller of crowds. Lingering lyrics, long-lasting and loud. Left y'all, ah to the left y'all. Because I rock upon the mike real def y'all. And to the right y'all, ah to the right y'all. Because I rock upon the mike all night y'all. You see, I. want respect, if I'm correct. They're all like a ball that I have checked. And the shots they take have no effect. The punk tried to dunk but he broke his neck. Cause I rock harder, and I get farther.

Dogs,"Dogs. You got to be crazy, you gotta have a real need. You gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street. You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed. And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight. You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking. And after a while, you can work on points for style. Like the club tie, and the firm handshake. A certain look in the eye and an easy smile. You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to. So that when they turn their backs on you. You'll get the chance to put the knife in. You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder. You know, it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder. As you get older. Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south. Hide your head in the sand. Just another sad old man. All alone and dying of cancer. And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown. And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone. And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around. So have a good drown, as you go down all alone. Dragged down by the stone. (Stone, stone, stone...). Gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused. Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used. Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise. If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze. Deaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending. That everyone's expendable, and no one has a real friend. And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner. Everything's done under the sun. But you believe at heart everyone's a killer. Who was born in a house full of pain. Who was trained not to spit in the fan. Who was told what to do by the man. Who was broken by trained personnel. Who was fitted with collar and chain. Who was given a pat on the back. Who was breaking away from the pack. Who was only a stranger at home. Who was ground down in the end. Who was found dead on the phone. Who was dragged down by the stone.",Pink Floyd,Rock,Shine On,1977.0,negative

There I used up all my money. I was looking for your ass. This way or no way. You know I'll be free. Just like that bluebird. Now, ain't that just like me?

Now and then I let it go, I ride the waves I can't control. I'm learnin' how to build a better boat. I hate waitin', ain't no patience in these hands. I'm not complainin', sometimes it's hard to change a man. I think I'm stronger than I was. I let God do what he does. If it's workin', I don't know, when I get done the thing may not float.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yo. When it all got started we were steadily just gettin' rejected. It seemed like nothin' we could do would ever get us respected. At best we were stressed. At the worst they probably said we're pathetic. Had all the pieces to that puzzle, just the way to connect it. I was fightin' through every rhyme, tightenin' up every line. Never restin' the question if I was out of my mind. It finally came time to do it or let it die. So we put the chips on the table and told 'em to let it ride. Sing it, yeah!.

But in the shadow of the hospital. At 508. I saw God today. I've been to church. I've read the book. I know He's there. But I don't look. Near as often as I should. His fingerprints are everywhere. I just look down and stop and stare. Open my eyes and then I swear. I Saw God Today. Saw a couple walking by. They were holding hands. And she had that glow. Yeah, I couldn't help. But I noticed that she was starting to show. Stood there for a minute. Taking in the sky. Lost in that sunset. A splashing down from mounting in shades of red.

And that's the magic number. (What does it all mean?). Difficult preaching is Posdnuos' pleasure. Pleasure and preaching starts in the heart. Something that stimulates the music in my measure. Measure in my music, raised in three parts. Casually see but don't do like the Soul. Cause seein' and doin' are actions for monkeys. Doin' hip hop hustle, no rock and roll. Unless your name's Brewster, cause Brewster's a Punk (three). Parents let go cause there's magic in the air. Criticising rap shows you're out of order. Stop look and listen to the phrase Fred Astaires. And don't get offended while Mase do-si-do's your daughter. A tri-camera rolls since our music's now set. Fly rhymes are stored on a Da.I.S.Y. production. It stands for ""Da Inner Sound, Y'all"" and y'all can bet. That the action's not a trick, but showing the function. Everybody wants to be a deejay. Everybody wants to be an emcee. But being speakers are the best. And you don't have to guess. De La Soul posse consists of three. This here piece of the pie. Is not dessert, but the course that we dine. And three out of every darn time. The effect is ""Mmmm"" when a daisy grows in your mind. Showing true position, this here piece is. Kissin' the part of the pie that's missin'. When that negative number fills up the cavity. Maybe you can subtract it. You can call it your lucky partner. Maybe you can call it your adjective. But odd as it may be. Without my 1 and 2 where would there be. My three: Mase, Pos and me. And that's the Magic Number. Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul. Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds. Common are speakers who honor the scroll. Scrolls written daily creates a new sound. Listeners listen cause this here is wisdom. Wisdom of a Speaker, a Dove and a Plug. Set aside a legal substance to feed 'em. For now get 'em high off this dialect drug. Time is a factor so it's time that counts. Count not the negative actions of one. Speakers of soul say it's time to shout. Three forms the soul to a positive sum. Dance to this fix and flex every muscle. Space can be filled if you rise like my lumber. Advance to the tune but don't do the hustle. Shake, rattle, roll to my Magic Number. Now you may try to subtract it. But it just won't go away.

This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine. And last night was just another distraction. Or a reaction of what we consider madness. I know exactly what happened. You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help. Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel. Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up. But the type of bullet that stuck. Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands. My plan's rather vindictive. Everybody's a victim in my eyes. When I ride it's a murderous rhythm. And outside became pitch black. A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!"". I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck. That same mentality I told my brother not to duck. In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors. I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover. The life that I knew as a youngin. In pajamas and dun-ta-duns. When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb. Niggas like me never prosper. Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted. This Piru shit been in me forever. So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever. And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did. Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big. And if I die before your album drop, I hope. You wrote a song about my sister on your tape. And called it Section.80. The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby"". What's crazy was I was hearin' about it. But doubted your ignorance. How could you ever just put her on blast and shit? Judgin' her past and shit? Well, it's completely my future. Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit. And I'ma need that forty dollars. Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow. In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed. By a married man, and father of three. My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys. Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's. He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week. This is the life of another girl damaged by the system. These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em. See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em. Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim. Of a family gene that show women how to be woman. Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'. Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught. Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed. And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit. My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain. If you can't fit the pumps I walk in? I'll wait Your rebuttal a little too late. And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song. 'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own. And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great? A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight. I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away. I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate. And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'. I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'. You lyin' to these motherfuckers. Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story. You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga. Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit. Sometimes I look in the mirror. And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away? If it's today, I hope I hear a. Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon. With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus. I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'. The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance. With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed. May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons. I suffer a lot. And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch. I tie my stomach in knots. And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death. My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats. That can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful. And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch. Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death. Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest. And you're right, your brother was a brother to me. And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me. In a direction to speak on somethin'. That's realer than the TV screen. By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between. Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told"". Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul. Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'. Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's. I count lives, all on these songs. Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong. Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong. And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone. Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in? Promise that you'll sing about me forever. Promise that you'll sing about me for ooooh. (On the phone). ""Ay, ay, ay, Where you 'bout to go?"". ""Nigga, the homie's brother-- nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!"". ""Nigga-- they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga."". ""Al- alright, nigga-- nigga just come-- alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back."". ""Arghh... Fuck!. So what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?"". ""Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like... nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga. We can go back right now"". ""Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!"". Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'. My own kind, but retirin' nothin'. Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'. Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't. Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst? Dope on the corner, look at the coroner. Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her. Stray bullets, AK bullets. Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't. Bring her back, who got the footage? Channel 9, cameras is lookin'. It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked. Banana clip, split his banana pudding. I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding. I know I'm good at. Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst. How many sins? I'm runnin' out. I lost count. Dreams of ballin' like Spalding. But only shotty bounce. The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth. Money is power (Money is power). Yours is ours (Yours is ours). Lay with a snitch, die with a coward. Hope we get rich, hope we can tower. Over the city with vanity with the music louder. The same song, a black flower. I'll show you how to. Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst. What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'? Hell is hot, fire is proven. To burn for eternity, return of the student. That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it. Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'. Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'. Now back to business, loadin' the guns in. Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'. The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion. Hereditary, all of my cousins. Too many sins, I'm runnin' out. Somebody send me a well for the drought. See all I know is takin' notes. On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke. My best days, I stress days. (Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know). Say ""fuck the world,"" my sex slave. Money, pussy, and greed what's my next crave? Whatever it is, know it's my next grave. Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'. Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' backwards. My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise. What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished? The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest. You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst. So hop in that water, and pray that it works."". Fuck! I'm tired of this shit!. I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit!. That's my brother, homie!. Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is? I know that's not what I think that is. Why are you so angry? See, you young men are dying of thirst. Do you know what that means? That means you need water, holy water. You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord. Do you want to receive God as your personal savior? Okay, repeat after me:. ""Lord God, I come to You a sinner."". (Lord God, I come to You a sinner). ""And I humbly repent for my sins."". (And I humbly repent for my sins). ""I believe that Jesus is Lord."". (I believe that Jesus is Lord).

Now I really understood what she was tryin' to say. She said, ""Son there'll be times when the tides are high. And the boat may be rocky, you can cry. Just never give up.

That makes me carry on. Boom-boom, couldn't have made it alone. I got a wonderful life, two kids on my own. With a strong foundation that was carved in stone. And my mama for the love that made my house a home. Made me wonder some time if this was meant to be. All this for a humble little guy like me. And all I ever really wanted was a family. To teach my kids the same value that she gave to me. She said, 'Son there'll be times when the tides are high. You can never give up,' uh-uh. And on. We nah turn no stepper, things a go better.

Just a Dream,"Just a Dream. It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen. All dressed in white. Going to the church that night. She had his box of letters in the passenger seat. Sixpence in a shoe. Something borrowed, something blue. And when the church doors opened up wide. She put her veil down. Trying to hide the tears. Oh, she just couldn't believe it. She heard the trumpets from the military band. And the flowers fell out of her hand. Baby, why'd you leave me? Why'd you have to go? I was counting on forever, now I'll never know. I can't even breathe. It's like I'm looking from a distance. Standing in the background. Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now. This can't be happening to me. This is just a dream. The preacher man said, ""Let us bow our heads and pray. Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt"". Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard. Then they handed her a folded up flag. And she held on to all she had left of him. Oh, and what could have been. And then the guns rang one last shot. And it felt like a bullet in her heart.

Thought you were smart when you took them on. But you didn't take a peep in their artillery room. All that rugby puts hairs on your chest. What chance have you got against a tie and a crest? Hello-hurray, what a nice day. For the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles. Hello-hurray, I hope rain stops play. Thought you were clever when you lit the fuse. Tore down the House of Commons in your brand new shoes. Composed a revolutionary symphony. Then went to bed with a charming young thing. Hello-hurray, cheers then, mate. It's the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles. Hello-hurray, an extremist scrape. With the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles. What a catalyst you turned out to be. Loaded the guns, then you run off home for your tea. Left me standing like a guilty schoolboy. Left me standing like a naughty schoolboy. We came out of it naturally the worst. Beaten and bloody, and I was sick down my shirt. We were no match for their untamed wit. Though some of the lads said they'd be back next week. Hello-hurray, it's the price to pay. To the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles.

Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants. And blew up my-my-myself again. Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin. Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin. Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik. How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida. Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then. Dr. Dre said, ""Hell yeah!"".

Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap. Beat strangler attack. So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap. Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track. Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick. Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'. Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel. My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill.

Why the fuck not, you only get one shot. Ate shit 'til I can't taste it. Chased it with straight liquor. Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint. And awake with a headache. And I take anything in rectangular shape. Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to. 'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you. So escapin' me is impossible. I latch onto you like aparasite.

Too Many Friends,Too Many Friends. My computer thinks I'm gay. I threw that piece of junk away. On the Champs-Elysees. As I was walking home. This is my last communique. Down the superhighway. All that I have left to say in a single tome. I got too many friends. Too many people that I'll never meet. And I'll never be there for. I'll never be there for. Cause I'll never be there. If I could give it all away. Will it come back to me someday? Like a needle in the hay or an expensive stone. I got a reason to declaim. The applications are to blame. For all my sorrow and my pain. A feeling so alone. What's the difference anyway. When all the people do all day. Is stare into a phone. I'll never be there.,Placebo,Rock,Loud Like Love,2013.0,negative
Atlanta,Atlanta. She lives in a bungalow. She kills me with rose-garden thorns. She waits for me. My love is unusual. It's painted with roses and thorns. With her i'm complete. She lives by the wall. And waits by the door. She walks in the sun. To me. Visions of mexico seduce me. It goes to my head so carefully. Memories of candles and incense. And all of these things remember these. She comforts me when. The candles blow out. The cake has grown mold. But the memories are sweet. The laughter's all gone. But the memories are mine. The mexican princess.

To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view. You mention me, millions of views, attention in news. I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you. Billions of views, your ten cents are two. Skim through the music to give shit reviews. To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse. Don't get misconstrued, business as us'. Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do. Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get. What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to. Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow. Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no. Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adios. I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though. Not even dissin', it just ain't for me. All I am simply is just an emcee. Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?). Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean. Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably. Shake the world up if it were up to me. Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill. I should eat a pill, probably I will. Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death. I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath. Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed. Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (""Evil"" spelled). Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick.

Jesus Christ, man, how many times is. Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!). You won't ever see Em icy. But as cold as I get on the M-I-C. I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze.

I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo. The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to. What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it? I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two. And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner. If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner.

'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest. With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist. And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless. What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa). Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it. Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic. With a bottle full of malt liquor. But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer. The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom. If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet. I don't see why y'all even started with me. I get in beefs, my enemies die. I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased. I'm east side, never be caught slippin'. Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink. I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats. I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze. ""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage. The Thing ain't even orangeoh my God, that's a reach!"". Shout to all my colorblind people. Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green.

Express Yourself,"Express Yourself. Dr. Dre: Yo, man, it's a lot of brothers out there flakin' and perpetratin' but scared to kick reality. Ice Cube: Man, you've been doin' all this dope producing, but you ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is. Dr. Dre: So what you want me to do? ... (Express yourself). I'm expressing with my full capabilities. And now I'm living in correctional facilities. Cause some don't agree with how I do this. I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist. I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary. But my technique is very necessary. Blame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky. When you got a subject and a predicate. Add it on a dope beat and that'll make you think. Some suckers just tickle me pink. To my stomach, cause they don't flow like this one. You know what? I won't hesitate to dis one. Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this. Some drop science, well I'm dropping English. Even if Yella makes it a cappella. I still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess. Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage. And brain damage on the mic don't manage nothing. But making a sucker and you equal, don't be another sequel. Express yourself. Come on and do it. Now, getting back to the PG. That's program, and it's easy. Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow. Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow. The words, the style, the trend, the records I spin. Again and again and again, yo, you on the other end. Watch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help. There's no fessing and guessing while I'm expressing myself. It's crazy to see people be. What society wants them to be, but not me. Ruthless is the way to go, they know. Others say rhymes that fail to be original. Or they kill where the hip-hop starts. Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts. Some musicians cuss at home. But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone. Yeah, they want reality but you won't hear none. They rather exaggerate a little fiction. Some say no to drugs and take a stand. But after the show they go looking for the dopeman. Or they ban my group from the radio, hear N.W.A and say ""Hell no!"". But you know it ain't all about wealth as long as you make a note to. From the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart. Then expression is a big part of it. You ain't efficient when you flow. You ain't swift, moving like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis. There's a little bit more to show. I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo. Or a lesson, all of 'em expression. And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wesson for you. I might ignore your record because it has no bottom. I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn. It's Dre on the mic, getting physical. Doing the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob. Yes, I'm macabre but you know you need this. And the knowledge is growing, just like a fetus. Or a tumor but here's the rumor. Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good. When I start expressing myself, Yella slam it. Cause If I stay funky like this, I'm doing damage. Or I'mma be too hyped and need a straight jacket. I got knowledge and other suckers lack it. So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic. Ask what it's like, it's like we getting hype tonight. Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health.

'Cause the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight. I'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out. I got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run.

It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear. But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears. By now, no doubt that we were heading south. I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth. 'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch. It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch. I'm screamin'. Look at the trouble we're in. We were parked out by the tracks. We're sitting in the back and we just started getting busy. When she whispered ""What was that?"". ""The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are"". And that was when she started screamin'. ""That's my dad outside the car!"". Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition. Must have wound up on the floor while we were switching our positions. I guess they knew that she was missing. As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing.

Back to school time come. 'cuz when a gunman work. If he is successful. And the job is well done. Then there will be an unsolved crime. With no one to fill out all blank line. John Public haffi hear and deaf. Informer get a kuff, kaff, kweff. Does he get nervous just like you and I? Watching out if the police pass by. 'cuz any day you hear a gunman fail. Then it's either dead house or jail. What will it cost to make a gunman rich? How many lives before a gunman switch? The truth me want the youth them stop ignore. Say the majority of gunman poor, oya oh. If one don rise then a next one fall. And when a gunman makes choice. I wonder what goes through a gunman's mind. And does a gunman think twice? Before him takes another someone's life? I wonder what it is a gunman say. To the Father when a gunman pray. Does he kiss his kids to bed at night? Making sure the blanket tucked just right? Nothing no scary like a gunman voice. When people beg a gunman think twice. And him say no. Wha coulda scary like a gunman voice.

I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in. I pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and then I followed it in. I watched myself crawlin' out as I was a-crawlin' in. I got up so tight I couldn't unwind. I saw so much I broke my mind. Someone painted ""April Fool"" in big black letters on a ""Dead End"" sign.

Listen, this is my evaluation. This shit oversaturated, y'all can get evacuated. Kids sippin' Actavis and they ain't even activated. Married to the Internet, stuck in place, salivatin'. Ain't nobody graduatin'. Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it. That's why I gotta hate it. Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration. Damn, I'm gettin' aggravated. Fuck, I'm gettin' agitated. Teachers so underpaid in these fuckin' schools. The police got our name in all they databases. Girls be thirteen actin' twenty-two. Niggas be forty-four actin' half they ages. Somebody tell me, what the fuck is goin' on? These niggas in tight shit, I'm in the fuckin' Matrix. It's lookin' like a sign of the revelation.

In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem I was this good scoffed, I just shook off. Prob'ly reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf. Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant. But based on how I ascended. See how plain it was now, they want me to jet. But no one really gave a fuck about my descent, 'til I took off. Mistook me because I looked soft. But I stood tall, I just followed the (Doctor's orders). So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off. Decided opposing you is what I'm 'posed to do, all's. I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls. And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all. You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls. And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone.

The drama setter, I'm going in, already got an arm and head in. Whoever said words are just words ain't heard me word 'em. I give a fuck if my image even ends up taking a personal hit. Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned in this bitch. And whatever bitches feel like they didn't deserve what they get. And whatever consequences come with every verse. It's worth it, so Doc turn the beat on. Whose turn is it to get murdered on it? And here's to all the years I spent toein' a line to overtime. As sure as a mole is blind. In my mind I'm still underground as a groundhog. And I'ma go for mine, like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find. No signs of slowin', these lines are my 9's. I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind. All I needed was someone to co-sign. Been a (Doctor's) assault rifle. With the sniper scope for this whole time.

I chose the road of passion and pain (passion and pain). Sacrificed too much and waited in vain. Gave up my power ceased being queen. Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend. See, torn and confused wasted and used. Reached the crossroad which path would I choose. Stuck and frustrated I waited, debated. For something to happen that just wasn't fated. Thought what I wanted was something I needed. When momma said no I just should have heeded. Misled I bled 'till the poison was gone. And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn. Father you saved me and you showed me that life. Was much more than being some foolish man's wife. Showed me that love was respect and devotion. Greater than planets and deeper than any oceans. See, my soul was weary but now it's replenished. Content because that part of my life is finished. I see him sometimes and the look in his eye. Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold.

Time to heal our women, be real to our women. And if we don't we'll have a race of babies. That will hate the ladies that make the babies. And since a man can't make one.

It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent. And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen. I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind. Last night my buddy lost his whole family. It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity. It seems the rain'll never let up. I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up. You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours. They got money for wars but can't feed the poor. Say there ain't no hope for the youth. And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future. And then they wonder why we crazy.

And uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own. I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone. Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome.

'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it. And don't blame me I was given this world, I didn't make it. And now my son's gettin' older and older. And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders.

And I'm not ashamed for being so cautious. For love ain't a game, no it ain't a game... so. If i gave my heart to you what would you do with it? Would you tear it apart or would you look after it? Would you tear it apart or would you treasure it? 0h what is the point in starting something you can't continue. With a broken heart first day can't help you. So you got to be sure from the start .

Oh~ baby somebody tell me. If i gave my heart to you... girl. So what would you do with it. oh baby~. Tell me what would you do with it. oh~ Yeah~. Well I hope that you're sure. That what you say affects and not illusions. And you possess the right solutions. To be sure, we will get through. For so many before me have given their heart away completely. Without thinking over the matter deeply then realised when its too late. That love can bring joy but then again can be painful. For love ain't a game, you know it ain't a game... so. Oh~ baby. Oh~ baby... Somebody tell me, tell me, tell me. If i gave my heart to you girl tell me what would you do with it?",Maxi Priest,Reggae,Easy to Love,,positive
Light It Up,"Light It Up. I open my eyes, reach for the phone. Not a word from you baby. It don't leave my sight since we had that fight. Can't remember but maybe. I blew you up. In the middle of the night again. You were drinking with your friends. You ignored it but you got it. I get so neurotic about it baby. 'Cause I know you're reading your phone. I can't help from going crazy. Thinking you might not be all alone. I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it. I feel the buzz in my truck. And I almost wreck it. I always got it on me. Just in case you want me. So, if you're looking for my love. Then light it up. Every time I unlock my screen. I hope I see one of them red lipstick 'I miss you' pictures. I'm on your clock, you're in control. You want me now baby go figure. My worlds at the tips of your fingers. Yeah baby, then light it up. I go to sleep, I check it. In the middle of the night, I check it. I feel the buzz in my bed. And I don't get no rest. Yeah baby, light it up.",Luke Bryan,Country,What Makes You Country,2017.0,negative
Destination,"Destination. Our instruments have no way. Of measuring this feeling. Can never cut below the floor. Or penetrate the ceiling. In the space between our houses. Some bones have been discovered. But our procession lurches on. As if we had recovered. Draconian winter unforetold. One solar day, suddenly you're old. Your little envelope just makes me cold. Makes destination start to unfold. Our documents are useless. Or forged beyond believing. Page forty-seven is unsigned. I need it by this evening. In the space between our cities. A storm is slowly forming. Something eating up our days. I feel it every morning. Destination, destination. It's not a religion, it's just a technique. It's just a way of making you speak. Distance and speed have left us too weak. And destination looks kind of bleak. Our elements are burned out. Our beasts have been mistreated. I tell you, it's the only way. We'll get this road completed. In the space between our bodies. The air has grown small fingers. Just one caress, you're powerless. Like all those clapped-out swingers.",The Church,Rock,Starfish,1988.0,negative

I don't know where else I can go. Over. See, the sea wants to take me. The knife wants to slit me. Do you think you can help me? Sad veiled bride, please be happy. Handsome groom, give her room. Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly. Though she needs you more than she loves you. And I know it's over - still I cling. Over and over and over and over. Over and over. I know it's over, and it never really began. But in my heart it was so real. And you even spoke to me, and said:. ""If you're so funny. Then why are you on your own tonight? And if you're so clever. If you're so very entertaining. If you're so very good-looking. Why do you sleep alone tonight? I know... 'cause tonight is just like any other night. That's why you're on your own tonight. With your triumphs and your charms. While they're in each other's arms..."". It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate. It takes strength to be gentle and kind. Over, over, over, over.

"Mama, I’m In Love Wit A Gangsta","Mama, I’m In Love Wit A Gangsta. Verse 1: Coolio. Hey baby, how you doin? What's goin on? I'm sittin in my motherfuckin cell, it's the same song. Tell my kids that I love em but don't tell em that I'm doing. Keep tryin' and tell em I'll be home soon. Oh baby I'm goin crazy. Cos I keep seein shit that amaze me. Still I had to kill a motherfucker last week. He thought I was a punk and tried to creep up on me in my sleep. I just think that I could hold or squeeze or touch or buck ya. But I can't, so fuck it. I'mma behind these bars and it's burnin like nitro. I might go psycho, the man on the tower got a rifle. Aw shit, there the lights go.. *phone ringing*. (Hello). Chorus: LeShaun. Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta (damn). Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta (y'know). Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta and I know he's a killer. But I love dat nigga. Bridge: LeShaun. Hey ba-by. What's happenin honey? How you doin? I miss you. Verse 2: LeShaun. The kids keep askin where's their papa? I had to tell em daddy got caught by the coppers. It's time for me to raise em up proper by myself. It's a goddamn struggle when a bitch ain't got no help. Now everybody tellin me that you ain't shit black. And when you get out, you'll jack and probably go right the fuck back. Damn, the pressure's gettin hot and heavy. And yeah, I'm gettin sweated by your homey in the blue and white Chevy. But now he's got a condo and a brand new Lexus. Wants me to take a trip with him down to Texas. The ends don't justify the means. And in another life he might've been the man of my dreams. But you know I got your back to the motherfuckin end. But a bitch can't even trip like she doen't need a friend. Chorus. Interlude:. (Hello, you have a collect call from...). Coolio!. (If you choose to accept this call please press 5 now). *number dialed*. Verse 3: Coolio. What the fuck you mean you need a friend? I can't be havin no niggas round my kids. Don't you make me break up outta this motherfucker. And start killin motherfuckers, SHIT!. I know it's rough, I know it's tough. But when you fumble in the game sometimes you get locked up. You better stay away from that punk ass bitch, he ain't shit. And I don't wanna have to kill him. Cos think about the times that we used to have. Don't make me reach out and touch that ass. You put yourself in danger when you fuck with a buster. Like shootin dice without a pistol in a circle of murderers. You got more class than the average-type hooker bitch. Don't switch, he gotta grip but he ain't rich. Now I gotta jet, but if you've got the cheque. Give a nigga a look and put somethin on my books. Peace. Verse 4: LeShaun. Aiyo remember the homey with the Lexus, he took the trip to Texas. Now he's wearin the fuckin Lexus like a necklace. So tell me, what's the drill, baby pa? What's a bitch to do? My nigga's stretched in the pen since '92. Them visits ain't doin the trick, drop fucks make me sick. Cos this po' puddy-tat needs a cat nip. And that motherfucker representin you, I think he resents you. He got evidence he never presents to. The people in court, I heard witnesses abortin. What's he doin about gettin you out to hold the fort? I got some ends, I'mma send you a dime and two dubs. Mama hates you but damn I got love for a gangsta.

Bad Guy,"Bad Guy. Part 1: Produced by S1 and M-Phazes. It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt. Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work. All it takes is one song on the radio, you're. Right back on it, reminding me all over again. How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt. Spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search. Maybe I needed to grow up a little first. Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt. But I'm coming for closure. Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed, for. The way that you turned your back on me. Just when I may have needed you most. Oh, you thought it was over? You could just close the. Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing? You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine. Well, I've never recovered. But tonight I bet you that what you're. 'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered. Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice. Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, ""Let it go, fuck this."". Heart's saying, ""I will, once I bury this bitch alive. Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset."". I flee the scene like it was my last ride. You see right through. Oh, you had me pegged the first time. You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify. What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy. I just hate to be the bad guy. (Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un). And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch. To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit. Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it? Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch!. Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit. Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!. You left our family in shambles. And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed? May be gone but he's not forgotten. And don't think 'cause he's been out the pictures. So long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to get ya. You're wrong and that shit was rotten. And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, cold. Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through? Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to? Not once you call to ask me how I'm doin'. Letters, you don't respond to 'em. Fuck it, I'm coming to see you. And, gee, who better to talk to than you? The cause of my problems. My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on you. Poof, then I'm gone, voosh. I've been drivin' around your side of this town. Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now. Finally I found your new address, park in your drive. Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life. And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva. My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house. See, it's sad it came to this point. Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment. To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy. I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy. It's revenge that I seek. So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window. Like I reached my full potential: I peeked. Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep. Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak. All the way 'round to the back porch. Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this. You don't plan for intruders beforehand? Surprised to see me? Cat caught your tongue? Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung. Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan. Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans. Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk? And here's your Bronco hat. You can have that shit back 'cause they suck. It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it. We're in the car right now wait, here comes my favorite lyric. ""I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"". And hey, here's a sequel to my. Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy. How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun!. Last album now, 'cause after this you'll be officially done. Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell. Bitch, I even have your initials. I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it. Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck. The best place you could be buried alive is right here. Two more exits, time is quite near. Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear. That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea, as cops appear in my driver's side mirror. (Oh, God! Police! Aaaghh!). Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least. New plan, Stan!. Slim: ""Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"". Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge. Ha ha, big bro, it's for you; Slim, this is for him. And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good. Now say you hate homos again!. Part 2: Produced by StreetRunner. I also represent. Anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend. I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in. I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen. Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin. Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in. When they say all of this is approachin' its end. But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again. Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds. Toilets clogged, yeah, 'cause I'm talking a lot of. Shit but I'm backing it all up. But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers. After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience. I'm the ringing in your ears. I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils. Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts. I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged. Grab for some water. But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow. I'm the bullies you hate that you became. With every faggot you slaughtered. Coming back on you, every woman you insult. Batter, but the double-standards you have. When it comes to your daughters. I represent everything you take for granted. 'Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona. Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic. Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone. 'Cause after all the glitz and the glam. No more fans that are calling your name. Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them. I'm the hindsight to say, ""I told you so!"". Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow. I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow. If you don't stop after they call ya. Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits. When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip. The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions. If there's anything you have left to say. 'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother. So 'fore you rest your case. Better make sure you're packin' a wallop. So, one last time, I'm back. Before it fades into black and it's all over. Behold the final chapter in a saga. Tryin' to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle. Twice, the magic that started. It all, tragic portrait of an artist. Tortured, trapped in his own drawings. Tap into thoughts blacker and darker. Than anything imaginable; here goes a wild stab in the dark.

Is grinding slow, but grinding still. Walking home, a youth gets killed. Police free to shoot at will. Nine to five you know the drill. Weekends are a short lived thrill. Cup runneth over till it spill. Take until they've had their fill. Some of us think we're too big. 'Cause the system gives us jobs. Even though it's just a low paying gig. Some of us will boast and brag. And those of us who think we're small. Just because we don't have much. That's really not the case at all. There's riches that the flesh can't touch. Some of us won't respect names. Some of us won't respect loves. Some of us don't respect life. Even though we worship God. And some of us won't let go faith. No matter what the price may cost. Some of us won't practice hate. Because we still believe in love. Working for a dollar bill. Walking home, a child gets killed. Neighbors free to shoot at will. Hurt' to see the old slave mill. Nine to five, we know the drill. Weekends are such a short-lived thrill. Most of us think we're too good. Just because material gain. If we were living as we should. Then less of us would be in pain. Those who are misunderstood. Still deserve a voice to claim. The things that are still meaningful. To each and all of us the same. And some will say the cups are full. And give Jah thanks to what we've gained. And some will say there's much more weight to pull. And them will tell you that straight up and plain. And some will think outside the box. While some of us will hold our lanes. And some of us we write the facts. While some of us a chop down cane. What men won't and what they will. Hurts to see the old slave mill.

Why don't you leave your name and your number. And I'll get back to you. Hey how are ya doin'. But leave your name and your number. Once again it's another rap bandit. Fiending at I and I can't stand it. Wanna be down with the Day-Glo. Knocking on my door, saying, ""a yo yo"". ""I got a funky new tune with a fly banjo"". I can't understand what the problem is. I find it hard enough dealing with my own biz. How'd they get my name and number. Then I stop to think and wonder. Bout a plan, yo man I gotta step out town. You wanna call me up? Take my number down. It's 222-2222. I gotta answering machine that can talk to you. It goes. Yo, check it, exit the old style, enter's the new. But nothing's new 'bout being hawked by a crew. Or should I say flock cause around every block. There's Harry, Dick, and Tom, with a demo in his palm. Now I'm with helping those who want to help themselves. And flaunt a nut that's doggy as in dope. But it's not the mood to hear. The tales of limousines and pails. Of money they'll make like a pro. I be like, ""Yo black, just play me the tape"". But at the show the time to spare I just make. But the songs created in they shacks. Are so wick-wick-wack, situations like this. And now I hate they give me smiles Kool-Aid wide and ask. ""was it def?"". And with the straighest face I be like, ""hell yes."". I slip them the digits to Papa Prince Paul. So I don't go AWOL but yet I know when they call they get. Party at the dug-out on Diction Ave. Haven't been to the jam in quite a while. Figure I'll catch up on the latest styles. 'Stead piles and piles of demo tapes by the miles. All I wanna do is cut on the decks wild. But edition up here by the miles to the center. Reliever of duty, Plug One mosies in. And I be like, ""Yo G, Pos does all the producing"". Now woe is me to the third degree. Mase pulls the funny so I make like a bunny, jettin'. But I'm getting used to this demo abuse. Getting raped and giving birth to a tape. Cause there's no escape from the clutches of a hawker. Attached to my success, sent like a stalker. Make way to my radius playin' fly guy. Try to get on my back they force like Luke Sky. Me, Myself, and I go through this act daily. And rarely do I not. No matter how I dodge some jackal always nails me. No matter what the plot. And even out on tour they be like. ""Yo, I got a tape to play you back at the hotel"". I be like, ""oh swell"". Unveil the numeric code to dial my room. And tell them to call me at noon. But of course there's no answering machine in my room. But a pretty young adorer who I swung on tour. And if it rings while we're alone she'll answer the phone. And with the quickness she'll recite like a poem. ""Hey, you done did the right thing, dial up my ring ring. Now you're waiting on the beep. Say, I would love if you'd sing. The tune to Tru instead of fronting on the speak."". So no problemo, just play the demo and at the end it's break out time. Please oh please don't press rewind cause I'll just lay it down the line. POS:. Hey how ya doing. And we'll get back to you.. peace. 'Yo what's up man, this is Ronald Master down with the Fish Tank. Posse, man, you know man, so you know you can just hook. Me up, True.

You were always so lost in the dark. How you used to be. Slow drowned. You were angels. So much more than everything. Hold for the last time then slip away quietly. Open my eyes.

So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow. I flip-flop and serve hoes with a fat dick. Til I die, I'm still screaming out: ""bitches ain't shit!"". Now I'm the mack daddy, had he not known about. The city where I'm from: Dum diddy dum. As you groove to the gangster shit. The D-O-double G, the P-O-U-N-D. The gangster clique.

Song on Fire,"Song on Fire. The first words that come out. And I can see this song will be about you. I can't believe that I can breathe without you. But all I need to do is carry on. The next line I write down. And there's a tear that falls between the pages. I know that pain's supposed to heal in stages. But it depends which one I'm standing on. I write lines down, then rip them up. Describing love can't be this tough. I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if. I could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly. Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon. Play it for the world, but it won't mean much. Unless I sing this song to you. I'm dying to show you. This could end happily ever after. There doesn't ever have to be disaster. And all you have to do is sing along. Impossible describing love. I could set this song on fire. Sing this song to you. Light this old guitar on fire, I'd still hear the notes. Drown the melody in water, I'd still hear its ghost. Sing it with somebody else, but we'd be out of tune. I could set this, I could set this.

Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping. Show no emotion, against your coding. Just act as hard as you can. You don't need a friend. Boy, you're the man.

St. Vitus Dance,"St. Vitus Dance. Back in the good old days when dancing meant exploding. The idea was simple for a decent overloading. And for a multiple flash with no cords attached. He came up with a more remote flash trigger. It's connected to an accessory to his hip. Which automatically fires in perfect synchro. But perhaps his most exciting development is his angle. They call it the Dance. It's the St. Vitus Dance. Such flexibility. What an accessory. See his soft bounce. What flexibility. Such a soft bounce. Ah. And for special effects he has six filters. Three coloured red with the others pilfered. And if you really want to know what that means. He could throw a blue flash from eighty-five feet. Of course you might want to check out your own little output. So we devised a few simple and easy-to-crack contortions. So you can bump and scrape all the day through. With the Dance. The St. Vitus Dance. Su-such a soft bounce. Check his hot shoe. Feel his output. He's a light machine. See his angle. Ah ah ah ah. Ah ah ah ah ah ah. Do it. Do it, do it.

Drive (For Daddy Gene),"Drive (For Daddy Gene). It was painted red, the stripe was white. It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light. Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta. I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her. We put on a shine, put on a motor. Built out of love, and made for the water. Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten. A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten. It was just an old plywood boat. With a '75 Johnson and electric choke. A young boy, two hands on the wheel. I can't replace the way it made me feel. And I would turn her sharp. And I would make it whine. He'd say, ""You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides"". Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line. But I was king of the ocean. When Daddy let me drive. Just an old half ton short bed Ford. My Uncle bought new in '64. Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking. A couple of burnt valves and he had it going. He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load. Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road. I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals. Smiling like a hero that just received his medal. It was just an old hand me down Ford. With three speed on the column and a dent in the door. I can't replace the way it made me feel and. I would press that clutch. And I'd keep it right. He'd say ""A little slower son, you're doing just fine"". Just a dirt road with trash on each side. But I was Mario Andretti. I'm grown up now, three daughters of my own. I let them drive my old Jeep. Across the pasture at our home. Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file. And pull out that old memory. And think of me and smile and say. It was just an old worn out Jeep. With rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet. A young girl, two hands on the wheel. And he'd say ""Turn it left"" and ""Steer it right"". Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine. Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride. But I was high on a mountain. Oh he let me drive.",Alan Jackson,Country,Drive,2002.0,positive

All for a chance to be a star. Nowhere seems to be too far. No more parties in L.A.. Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh. No more (Los Angeles). Please (Shake that body, party that bod-). Please (Shake that body, party that body). Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans. And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan. It was more than soft porn for the K-Man. She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van"". Uhmwell, cutie, I like your bougie booty. Come, Erykah Badu-mewell, let's make a movie. Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler. I show you the ropes, connect the dots. A country girl that love Hollywood. Mama used to cook red beans and rice. Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite. Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection. Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians. R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers. Music and iPhone cameras. This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think. That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean. He flew you in this motherfucker on first class. Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag. Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math? That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck. She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper. I said baby, ""Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards"". You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence. Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is. The head still good, though; the head still good, though. Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"". Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical. Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles. Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal. Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me. Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday. Bottle service, head service, I came in first place. The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek. The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee. And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets. Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity. And yeah, G, I was all for it. She said, ""K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet"". I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie. Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy. Scary, scary. Please, baby, no more parties in L.A.. Friday night, tryna make it into the city. Breakneck speeds, passenger seatsomethin' pretty. Thinking back to how I got here in the first place. Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base. A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds. And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs. Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous. When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list. Strippers get invited to where they only got hired. When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired. I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired. And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir. Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary. I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries. For all my niggas with babies by bitches. That use they kids as meal tickets. Not knowin' the disconnect from the father. The next generation will be the real victims. I can't fault 'em, really. I remember Amber told my boy. No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly. Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'. Of weak content and slow jammin'. But don't worry, this one's so jammin'. You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'. I be thinkin' every day. Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades. I be paranoid every time, the pressure. The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'. My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired. First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died. Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive. That's why I'd rather take the 405. I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim. But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him. Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents. What I'm supposed to do? Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints? Every agent I know, know I hate agents. I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant. Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance. It's just me, I do it my way, bitch. Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans. If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans. I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again. But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans. A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems. Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it. It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out. And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out. Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam. Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam. Thank God for me! (Los Angeles). Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!. I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful. Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful. I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes.

When will I finally get to rest through this oppression? They punish the people that's askin' questions. And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions. The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons. Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions. Be grateful for blessings. Don't ever change, keep your essence. The power is in the people and politics we address. Always do your best, don't let this pressure make you panic. And when you get stranded. And things don't go the way you planned it. Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference. Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen. If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change. It wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world. Got me stuck in the game. Hahaha, that's right. I know it seem hard sometimes. But, uh, remember one thing. Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that. So no matter how hard it get. Stick your chest out, keep your head up, and handle it.",2Pac,Hip-Hop,Me Against the World,1995.0,negative

I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'. I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks. It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox. I love payin' rent when the rent is due.

Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path. For police, I'm saying, ""Fuck you, punk!"". Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk. Pulling out a silly club, so you stand. With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand. But take off the gun so you can see what's up. And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up!. Make you think I'ma kick your ass. But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast. I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime. But I'ma smoke them now and not next time. Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me. Or any asshole that threatens me. I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope. Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me. The motherfuckin' villain that's mad. With potential to get bad as fuck. So I'ma turn it around. Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound. (Gunshot sounds). Yeah, somethin' like that. But it all depends on the size of the gat. Taking out a police would make my day. But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say. (Knocking sounds). Yeah, man, what you need? Police, open out!. Aww, shit. We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest. Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!. (Move, motherfucker, move now!). What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do? Just shut the fuck up. And get your motherfucking ass on the floor!. (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!). But I didn't do shit. Man, just shut the fuck up!. Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand. And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit? I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'. Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and. Shining the light in my face, and for what? Maybe it's because I kick so much butt. I kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast. On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger. Of an Uzi or an AK. 'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say. They put out my picture with silence. 'Cause my identity by itself causes violence. The E with the criminal behavior. Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor. Without a gun and a badge, what do you got? A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot. By me, or another nigga. And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger. (Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool!). And as you all know, E's here to rule. Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror. And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a. Dumb motherfucker with a gun. And if I'm rollin' off the 8, he'll be the one. That I take out, and then get away. While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say. The verdict:. The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck. White bread, chickenshit motherfucker. Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!. Get him out of here!. I want justice!. Get him the fuck out my face!. Out, right now!.

A Boy Named Sue,"A Boy Named Sue. My daddy left home when I was three. And he didn't leave much to ma and me. Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze. Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid. But the meanest thing that he ever did. Was before he left, he went and named me ""Sue."". Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke. And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk. It seems I had to fight my whole life through.. Some gal would giggle and I'd get red. And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head. I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue."". Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean. My fist got hard and my wits got keen. I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame. But I made a vow to the moon and stars. That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars. And kill that man who gave me that awful name. Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July. And I just hit town and my throat was dry. I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew. At an old saloon on a street of mud. There at a table, dealing stud. Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue."". Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad. From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had. And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye. He was big and bent and gray and old. And I looked at him and my blood ran cold. And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!. Now you're going to die!!"". Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes. And he went down, but to my surprise. He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear. But I busted a chair right across his teeth. And we crashed through the wall and into the street. Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer. I tell you, I've fought tougher men. But I really can't remember when. He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile. I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss. He went for his gun and I pulled mine first. He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile. And he said: ""Son, this world is rough. And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough. And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along. So I give ya that name and I said goodbye. I knew you'd have to get tough or die. And it's the name that helped to make you strong. He said: ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight. And I know you hate me, and you got the right. To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do. But ya ought to thank me, before I die. For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye. Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue. I got all choked up and I threw down my gun. And I called him my pa, and he called me his son. And I came away with a different point of view. And I think about him, now and then. Every time I try and every time I win. And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him. Bill or George! Anything but Sue!

I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on. But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone. When I was just a baby my mama told me, ""Son. Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"". But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die. When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry. I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car. They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars. Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free. But those people keep a-movin'. And that's what tortures me. Well if they freed me from this prison. If that railroad train was mine. I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line. Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay. And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away.",Johnny Cash,Country,Johnny Cash With His Hot and Blue Guitar,1955.0,negative

Used to look good in the videos now she look hideous. Now it's broken crack pipes with lipstick traces. Work the cold nights red district places. She seen more hotels then my tour suitcases.

For stayin out late night with all the parasites. Plottin on the way to cop a little piece of paradise. Her dignity the only thing that she could sacrifice.

And she without sinnin will spot the first stone. The feelin kicks in she's in the dark zone. Old friends walk pass goin bout there own. As if she is someone that they don't know. Then the King Of Kings lift her off the flo'. Sayin life is a thing when you learn you grow. She rise and fall like a star, her life write off like a car. Her face full of all kind of scar, always quick fi start a war. She can't keep herself up to par, she plays like a broken guitar. She always want take it to far. I doubt she ah go make it too far.

Fouler, than a weed smell,nigga, your tree fell. See how they Twitter, Facebook and Instagramming an email? Talking I'm sick, I got them shook and I bang 'em at retail. Until they cripple, see I cook, like I'm slanging a weed sale. Until I triple bread, and whoop 'em and drag 'em, like females (Sfu-ahe! Gasp!) Oh, see well, these niggas already know. The way that I fuck shit up, minus the details, the case is shut. Your bitch remind me of replacement butt. Kind of an ancient slut, it's going down. Like she was a basement fuck. Swell up this shit, like I'm sticking steaks in they gut. So gracefully and graciously, I painfully wake niggas up. Ragdolling these niggas, and attacking. Like apes in the cut, I'm waiting for the taking. While I break niggas neck, like a bracelet (fuck!). It's kinda like, me having a case in the truck. And drinking 'til I'm blasted. Harassing and erase a nigga (What!?). Keeping 'em open and blacking until I'm leaving 'em stuck. And got 'em happier, than a child in a park chasing a duck. While I'm chasing a buck. These funny niggas be chasing they luck. I be lacing them up, like boots. When I'm pushing they face in the mud. (Ahgah!) Missiles I fling, while I spit live wire.

Is my mind scrambled? 'Cause I'm litnarrow minded. But go through such a wide range of this emotion. That my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways. I just pulled up, in Clive Davis's driveway. With his personal memoir, saying ""He's bi!"". Waving a nine, a picket sign, egging his ride. Making him cry, ""Rape! ""then arrive naked. And drive straight through the gay pride parade. ""Yay!

But just in case you was thinking an inkling of replacing. The kingpin of crazy, you're wasting your ink then. So if this is any indication, of what you may be facing. You better make a distinction, 'cause you fake imitations. Are leaving a bad taste, fuck making a bad impression. That's the worst impersonation I've ever seen. Who raps nasally? Eyes hazely? Rhymes crazily, but sounds like he may. Need some Flonase when he's speaking? What kind of stupid question is that? ""Hey, Mrs. Abraham Lincoln!. Other than your husband's fucking brains that were leaking. How'd you think that play was this weekend?"". You ain't the real Slim Shady, sit your ass down, faggot. See me on a ballot, I'm running for class clown. Rich Democrat bitch, so I'm just the candidate. To come fuck up the whole party. Me and Flipmode starting a campaign. To have every campus, on a fucking rampage. Act my goddamn age? I ameight!. So let's get smashed and wake up the next day. With the room trashed, covered in Band-Aids. Glass ashtray smashed. Champagne splashed on the lampshades. But this ain't up for debate, this is undebatable. Shady for president ho, don't make me go take it back. To the days of old, with Sway & Tech radio. When I was taking so much NoDoz and LSD. I almost fell asleep on the Wake Up Show. Fuck you telling me, fools? I was rippin' shop, raisin' hell up in Drew's. When Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs. Me and Bus put it down, like a sick pet. You're fucking with vets, dog, fucking internet bloggers. ""I sit in front of my computer all day. And comment on everything, I'm an expert on everything, Everything sucksplay the next song!"". Guess if I hopped out your freaking laptop, you idiot prick. With Biggie and kicked the living shit out you, I'd be dead wrong. Son of God; I'm the S.O.G. Like a wet log, pores never get clogged. 'Cause I'm so full of self-esteem, that I sweat fog. Yes, yes, y'all (Wah! )steady on the left, y'all. Step off, 'fore you get stepped on. Soft? 'Bout as commercial as my fucking Learjet. Jealousy'll get you green as a Chia Pet.

Impossible,"Impossible. Yo, check check it. You can never defeat. Yo, check the method of this shit right here one time. The Gods. Sparking your braincells to the upmost. Impossible. Unlimited epidemics being spreaded. You know, we try and add on for y'all niggas. Yo, yo. Fusion of the five elements, to search for the higher intelligence. Women walk around celibate, livin' irrelevant. The most benevolent king, communicatin' through your dreams. Mental pictures been painted, Allah's heard and seen. Everywhere, throughout your surrounding atmosphere. Troposphere, thermosphere, stratosphere. Can you imagine from one single idea, everything appeared here. Understanding makes my truth, crystal clear. Innocent black immigrants locked in housing tenements. Eighty-Five percent tenants depended welfare recipients. Stapleton's been stamped as a concentration camp. At night I walk through, third eye as bright as a street lamp. Electric microbes, robotic probes. Taking telescope pictures of globe, babies getting pierced with microchips. Stuffed inside their earlobes, then examinated. Blood contaminated, vaccinated, lives fabricated. Exaggerated authorization, Food and Drug Administration. Testing poison in prison population. My occupation to stop the inauguration of Satan. Some claim that it was Reagan, so I come to slay men. Like Bartholomew, 'cause every particle is physical article. Was diabolical to the last visible molecule. A spaceknight like Rom, consume planets like Unicron. Blasting photon bombs from the arm like Galvatron. United Nations, gun bias style patient. Formulating rap plural a capella occupation. Conquer land like Napoleon, military bomb fest. We want sanitary food, planetary conquest. Thug peoples on some hardco' body shit. Get your shit together 'fore the fuck Illuminati hit. Dreams is free and escape is sleep. For a fool peep jewels, keep tools for tough time. The rule of rough mind, elevate, stay behind. The sun gotta shine, keep on, cremate. The whole Babylon, times up, move on. Kings on your pawn, checkmate, no fakes. Supposed through the gate, case closed. Things get froze, when it comes time, chosen ones. Will holding guns, we take flight with no fright. And attack, never fear cause our words is clear. What's been done can't be undone Son, we can't care. Cause the last days and times are surely here. Snakes and flakes get blown, by the righteous ones. Divine minds bind, we unified as one. Half of black folk, we half broke, smoke a bowl of weed shit. Our everlasting essence stay flying over Egypt. For you to defeat, the Gods. Impossible, you can never defeat. The gods. Call an ambulance, Jamie been shot, word to Kimmy. Don't go son, nigga you my motherfucking heart. Stay still son, don't move, just think about Keeba. She'll be three in January, your young God needs ya. The ambulance is taking too long. Everybody get the fuck back, excuse me bitch, gimme your jack. One, seven one eight, nine one one, low battery, damn. Blood comin out his mouth, he bleedin badly. Nahhh Jamie, don't start that shit. Keep your head up, if you escape hell we gettin fucked up. When we was eight, we went to Bat Day to see the Yanks. In Sixty-Nine, his father and mines, they robbed banks. He pointed to the charm on his neck. With his last bit of energy left, told me rock it with respect. I opened it, seen the God holdin his kids. Photogenic, tears just burst out my wig. Plus he dropped one, oh shit, here come his Old Earth. With no shoes on, screamin holdin her breasts with a gown on. She fell and then lightly touched his jaw, kissed him. Rubbed his hair, turned around the ambulance was there. Plus the blue coats, Officer Lough, took it as a joke. Weeks ago he strip-searched the God and gave him back his coke. Bitches yellin, Beenie Man swung on Helen. In the back of a cop car, Dirty Tasha are tellin. But suddenly a chill came through it was weird. Felt like my man, was cast out my heaven now we share. Laid on the stretcher, blood on his Wally's like ketchup. Deep like the Paul assassination with a sketch of it. It can't be, from Yoo-hoo to Lee's. Second grade humped the teachers, about to leave. Finally this closed chapter, comes to an end. He was announced, pronounced dead, y'all, at twelve ten. Now what my man is trying to tell y'all. Is that across the whole globe. The murder rates is increasin, and we decreasing. So at the same time, when you play with guns. When you play with guns, son. That causes the conflict of you going against your own.

High Hopes,"High Hopes. Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young. In a world filled with magnets and miracles. Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary. The ringing of the division bell had begun. Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway. Do they still meet there by the Cut. There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps. Running before time took our dreams away. Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground. To a life consumed by slow decay. The grass was greener. The light was brighter. With friends surrounded. The nights of wonder. Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us. To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side. Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again. Dragged by the force of some inner tide. At a higher altitude with flag unfurled. We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world. Encumbered forever by desire and ambition. There's a hunger still unsatisfied. Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon. Though down this road we've been so many times. The taste was sweeter. The dawn mist glowing. The water flowing. The endless river. For ever and ever. ""Is that Charlie? Hello Charlie!. Great..."".",Pink Floyd,Rock,The Division Bell,1994.0,negative

4 Your Eyez Only,"4 Your Eyez Only. Yeah (For your eyes). For your eyes only (For your eyes). For your eyes only, for your eyes only. (For your eyes, for your eyes). For your eyes only. Hey, niggas be dying on the daily. It seems my dreams faded for far too long. The consequences deadly. Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal. Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal. 'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off. Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause. Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black. Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack. And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me. Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet. Like I ain't out in the field like that. I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back. Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless. Screaming, ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless. That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic. To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven. This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic. I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets. But these felonies be making life the hardest. Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet. Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it. That's why I write this sonnet. If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break. Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it. (For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it. (For your eyes) For your eyes only. For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes, do you understand me? You probably grown now so this song'll hit you. If you hearing this, unfortunately means. That I'm no longer with you in the physical. Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive. He got me praying that the spiritual is real. So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too. So I know how part of you feels. Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me. Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me. I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots. And fiends that smoke rocks. I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot. I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance. Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance. Don't know if I ever had a chance. At a glance, I'm a failure. Addicted to pushing paraphernalia. But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once. Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years. My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted. So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging. Blood was staining the concrete. Older niggas I loved talked like they was above. Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money. Picked up the family business by the age of 13. Six years later was handed sentence. 'Round the same time is when you came in this world. Me and your mama thinking:. ""What the fuck we naming this girl?"". I told her ""Nina,"" the prettiest name that I could think of. For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19. Took me two felonies to see the trap. This crooked-ass system set for me. And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be. The one that set examples that was never set for me. I'm living fast, but not fast enough. 'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me. And if my past becomes the death of me. I hope you understand. It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count. Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout? Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated. 'Cause the cash running out? Niggas don't know how to act in a drought. See, baby girl, I realized. My definition of a real nigga was skewed. My views misshaped by new mixtapes. That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true. That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you. They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo. And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food. I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops. Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you. I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views. Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you. Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops. And the cyclical nature of doing time continues. My worst fear is one day that you come home from school. And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news. I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon. And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true. But maybe there's a chance that it's not. And this album remains locked. In a hard drive like valuable jewels. And I can teach you this in person. Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes. I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you. For your eyes, for your eyes only. One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling. What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling. I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing. But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice. And it was chilling, he said:. ""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children. I never asked for nothing, when times was hard. I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me. I dealt with the repercussions of my actions. I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit. But that shit was in my blood, you know my life. I know your momma, nigga, send my love. In case I never get a chance to speak again. I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib. That's the way I wished my family lived. But my granny crib was in the 'jects"". I had to interject like:. ""Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"". He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions. But I been having premonitions. Just call it visions from the other side. I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow. Like the time I'm living on is borrowed. With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father. Write my story down, and if I pass. Go play it for my daughter when she ready"". And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only. Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it. This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son. I dedicate these words to you and all the other children. Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation. That sent your pops to prison when he needed education. Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better. Although I know that means that I would never. Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled. When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro. With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old. Now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told. Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold. Not because he was the first. To get some pussy 12 years old. Not because he used to come through. In the Caddy on some vogues. Not because he went from bagging up. Them grams to serving O's. Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard. Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars. Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law"". Although that was true. Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you.",J. Cole,Hip-Hop,4 Your Eyez Only,2016.0,negative

Or a plowboy waitin' on the rain. We're all a little different, but we're all the same. Everybody doin' their own thing. I got my dirt road cred when I was twelve. On a no cab tractor hauling them bales. Backing in boats, fishing limb lines. Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines. Step side cover down in peanut dust. Friday night spotlight, and that was us. It might not have been you, but I can't judge. Just be proud of what makes you country. Does it run in your blood? Did it come from your daddy and mama? Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio? That feels so right. Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson? Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know. Me, I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church. Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt. Waiting for the fall to finally come along. So I can grab my gun and get my outside on. Might be from a city or a little farm town. Whatever kind of square that you drove around. Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down? You know you gotta let it out. I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve. Running bird dogs through them Georgia pines. It might not have been you, but I ain't judging. And just be proud of what makes you country.

Had no clue what you was going through. How could you be so strong? And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish. I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless. But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do. And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you. And I need to treat you better. Wish you could live forever.

A young man breaks away. He buys a gun, He steals a car. Tries to run, but he don't get far. As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man. Face down on the street with a gun in his hand.

There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done. Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'. Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep. 'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser. And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep. And when he finished speakin'. He turned back towards the window. Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep. And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even. But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.

And I'm down in the tube station at midnight. I fumble for change - and pull out the Queen. Smiling, beguiling. I put in the money and pull out a plum. Behind me.

I said I was down in the tube station at midnight. The last thing that I saw. As I lay there on the floor. Was ""Jesus Saves"" painted by an atheist nutter. And a British Rail poster read ""Have an Awayday - a cheap holiday - Do it today!"". I glanced back on my life. And thought about my wife. Cause they took the keys - and she'll think it's me.

'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday. Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away. Blown away. She heard those sirens screamin' out.

I need a neon church. Baptize me in that barroom smoke. Bartender, preach to me 'til my heart ain't broke no more. Ain't that what this place is for? I tried bended knee, hands-up prayin'. But damn did that hurt, don't just keep hangin' around. What I need right now. Just a-sippin' down that unholy water. Save that hurt-like-hell for tomorrow. I'll stay here all night.

Waiting for the dice to roll. Yeah, now, sitting here in limbo. Got some time to search my soul. I don't know where life will leave me. But I know where I have been. I can't say what life will show me. But I know what I have seen. Tried my hand at love and friendship. But all that is past and gone. This little boy is moving on. Waiting for the tide to flow. Knowing that I have to go. I don't know where life will take me. I don't know what life will show me. That is past and gone. And now it's time to move along. Gonna lead me on now.

I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry,"I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry. Hear that lonesome whippoorwill. He sounds too blue to fly. The midnight train is whining low. I'm so lonesome I could cry. I've never seen a night so long. When time goes crawling by. The moon just went behind the clouds. To hide its face and cry. Did you ever see a robin weep. When leaves begin to die?

There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see. If you won't I must say my goodbyes to thee. Oh, there's an island where all things are silent. I'm gonna whistle a tune. Oh, there's a desert, that's size can't be measured. I'm gonna count all the dunes. Out there's a world that calls for me, girl. Headin' out into the unknown. Way-fair with strangers and all kind of danger. Please don't say I'm goin' alone. I wasn't ready to die for you, baby. Doesn't mean I'm ready to stay. What good is livin' a life you've been given.

"Huntin’, Fishin’ & Lovin’ Every Day","Huntin’, Fishin’ & Lovin’ Every Day. Woah, woah. Wo-wooah, mmm. If I could make a living from walking in the woods. You can bet I'd be sitting pretty good. High on a hill looking at a field downwind. If I could make a nickel off a turning 'em bass. Never worry about the price of gas. I'd be wheeling and dealing and sittin' there reeling 'em in. Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day. That's the prayer that a country boy prays. Thank God He made me this way. Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day. Early in the morning, late in the evening. I'm getting red dirt rich and Flint River paid. Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day. I'd get a little Farm Pond bus. Sound of gravel when I'm backin' up. Pulling the string on a nine point nine two stroke, mercury. I love it when my baby wants to roll with me. Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree. Tuckin' her hair in my hat and she's ready to go. We get to huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day. I'm getting red dirt rich, Flint River pay. So while y'all are up there. Breathin' in that old dirty air. I'll be down here, knee deep, in the Muckalee. I wanna see them tall pines sway. Y'all close them eyes. Lets go there in our mind. That's the prayer this country boy prays. Black coffee in the morning, dark whiskey in the evening. I get red dirt rich and Flint River pay. Huntin', and fishin' and lovin' every day. Come on. Won't you come along with me. I know you wanna see. Yeah.",Luke Bryan,Country,Kill the Lights,2015.0,positive

Fire Squad,"Fire Squad. Nigga why you actin' like a ho? Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go. Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time? When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb? Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch? If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich? Come here baby why you always insecure? Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure. Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest. A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest. I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants. I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas. 'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine. My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun. In fact I just might need two, cause niggas say they the one. And I got something to prove. Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW. My inhibition's fighting my intuition. Premature premonition, showing me the demolition. Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time. Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing. You want the truth well come and listen. I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing. As fate passes you by, half of you try. The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly. One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be. A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me. Keep it true like me, Cole you might be. Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T. Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee. Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee. Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee. Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me!. BLAOOOW!. (Who's the king?). Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt. What you expected from me, I came from the dirt. Money my motivator, the songs that I sing. Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king. You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go. Will I return or will I burn, never know. Look in my eyes and see the future. But don't sugar coat it. Listen. History repeats itself and that's just how it goes. Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows. Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll. Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore. While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown. Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound. This year I'll prolly go to the awards dappered down. Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile. I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit. Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with. But not Jermaine, my aim too sick. I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick. You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid. I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid. And break the chains and change minds. One verse at a time, and claim 2-6. And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king? We all kings. (We all kings nigga). Kings of ourselves first and foremost. (True). While the people debate who's the king of this rap game. Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine. With every ounce of strength in his veins. To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it. But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it. Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic. With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates. And falls to the Earth from which it came. It's done. Ain't gonna be no more kings. Be wary of any man that claims. Because deep down he clings onto the need for power. The reality, he's a coward. Ultimately he's scared to die. And sometimes so am I. But when I'm in tune with the most high. I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side. Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I. Different kind of skin, different set of eyes. Two different minds, but only one God. (It's only one God nigga). It's for all the kings. 'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved.",J.

Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix. 'Cause the media is full of dirty tricks. Only God can judge me. Only God can judge me, only God. I hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' I can make it. Got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked. Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV. 'Cause everytime I breathe I think they killin' me. I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies. I wake up stranglin', tangled in my bed sheets. I call the nurse 'cause it hurts to reminisce. How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss. Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here. 'Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care? Try to remember but it hurts. I'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt. I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward. There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours. ""Black Power!"" is what we scream. As we dream in a paranoid state. And our fate is a lifetime of hate. Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace. 'Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat. No more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped. And they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped. Mr. Police, please try to see. That there's a million motherfuckers stressin' just like me. That which does not kill me can only make me stronger. That's for real. And I don't see why everybody feel as though. That they gotta tell me how to live my life. You know? Let me live, baby, let me live. Pac, I feel ya, keep servin' it on the reala. For instance, say a playa-hatin' mark is out to kill ya. Would you be wrong for buckin' a nigga to the pavement? He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'. Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law.

They called us and said we're gettin iller. There's no one chiller. It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller. As one def rapper, I know I can hang. I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang. Roll to the rock, rock to the roll. DMC stands for devastating mic control. You can't touch me with a ten foot pole. And I even made the devil sell me his soul. Now we crash through walls, cut through floors. Bust through ceilings and knock down doors. And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box.

Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds. Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees. Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC. I am from, around the way. And Run goes to school, every day. And Jay plays the records he has to play. And we get down with no delay, HEY!. I rock the party with the words I speak. And Run says the rhymes that are unique. And Jay cuts the records every day of the week. And we are the crew that can never be beat. So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend. Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end. The rhymes we say, shall set a trend. Because a devestating rap is what we send. Every jam we play, we break two needles. There's three of us but we're not the Beatles. My name is Darryl, you can call him D. You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC. People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?"". D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean. Like we said before, we rock hardcore. I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can jaw. And now we got the knack, to attract. Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac. We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot. When it comes to rock, give it all we got. To be MC's, we got what it takes. Let the poppers pop and the breakers break. We're cool cool cats, it's like that.

Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation. Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make. My mama came from a softer generation.

Disintegration,"Disintegration. Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery. The shameless kiss of vanity. The soft and the black and the velvety. Up tight against the side of me. And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed. And run in thickening streams of greed. As bit by bit it starts the need. To just let go my party piece. The aching kiss before I feed. The stench of a love for a younger meat. And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep. The holding up on bended knees. The addiction of duplicities. But I never said I would stay to the end. So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency. Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy. Screaming me over and over and over. I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery. Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery. Songs about happiness murmured in dreams. When we both of us knew how the ending would be. So it's all come back round to breaking apart again. Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again. Making it up behind my back again. Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again. Holding it up behind my head again. Cut in the deep to the heart of the bone again. Round and round and round and it's coming apart again. Over and over and over. And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces. I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone. I'm crying for sympathy, crocodiles cry. For the love of the crowd. And the three cheers from everyone. Dropping through sky. Through the glass of the roof. Through the roof of your mouth. Through the mouth of your eye. Through the eye of the needle. It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven. Than ever feel whole again. I knew I would leave you with babies and everything. Screaming like this in the hole of sincerity. Screaming it over and over and over. Stains on the carpet and stains on the memory.

A victim of the circumstance. The one who ought to give up. But she's just too hard headed. A single mom who works two jobs. Who loves her kids and never stops. With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter. I'm a survivor. I don't believe in self-pity. It only brings you down. May be the queen of broken hearts. But I don't hide behind the crown. When the deck is stacked against me. I just play a different game. My roots are planted in the past. Though my life is changing fast. Who I am is who I want to be. Oh, a single mom who works two jobs. Who loves her kids and never stop. But I must have had my mamma's will and God's. Amazing grace.",Reba McEntire,Country,Greatest Hits Volume III: I’m a Survivor,2001.0,positive

Stuck on you. Going to run my fingers thru your long black hair. Squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear. Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh. Stick, because I'm. Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall. Ain't going to do you no good at all. Because once I catch you and the kissing starts. A team of wild horses couldn't tear us apart. Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side. That's how love is going to keep us tied. I'm gonna stick like glue.",Elvis Presley,Rock,Elvis’ Golden Records Volume 3,1960.0,positive

Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan. Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spider-Man. So uhh, tick-tock and keep tickin'. While I get ya flippin' off the shit I'm kickin'. The Lone Ranger, code red, danger. Deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart. The vandal, too hot to handle. You battle, you're sayin' ""Goodbye"" like Tevin Campbell. Roughneck, Inspectah Deck's on the set. The Rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal. The way I make the crowd go wild, sit back, relax, won't smile. Rae got it goin' on, pal, call me the rap assassinator. Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger. And I'ma get mad deep like a threat. Blow up your project, then take all your assets. 'Cause I came to shake the frame in half. With the thoughts that bomb shit like math. So if you wanna try to flip, go flip on the next man. 'Cause I grab the clip and hit ya with 16 shots and more, I got. Goin' to war with the meltin' pot, akh. It's the Method Man, for short Mr. Meth. Movin' on your left, aah!. And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat. I wanna break full, cock me back. Small change, they puttin' shame in the game. I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame. And like Fame my style'll live forever. Niggas crossin' over, but they don't know no better. But I do, true, can I get a ""suue"". Enough respect due to the one-six-ooh. I mean O, yo check out the flow. Like the Hudson or PCP when I'm dustin'. Niggas off, because I'm hot like sauce. The smoke from the lyrical blunt make me *cough*. Ooh, what, grab my nut, get screwed. Oww, here comes my Shaolin style. True B-A-ba-B-Y-U. To my crew with the ""suuuuue"". Yeah, yeah, yeah. C'mon, baby baby, c'mon, baby baby.

The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin'. Ason Unique rollin' with the night of the creeps. Niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash. Bite my style, I'll bite your motherfuckin' ass. For cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me. Not long is how long that this rhyme took me. Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon. My pen that rocks from here to Oregon. Here's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback. I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back. I come with shit that's all types of shapes and sounds. And where I lounge is my stompin' grounds. I give an order to my peeps across the water. To go and snatch up props all around the border. And get far like a shootin' star. 'Cause who I are is livin' the life of Pablo Escobar. Point-blank as I kick the square biz. There it is, you're fuckin' with pros, and there it goes. Yo, chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that. It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at? Feelin' mad hostile, ran the apostle. Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel. Stroll with the holy roll, then attack the globe with the buckus style. The ruckus, ten times ten men committin' mad sin. Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin. Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums, we'll be. Comin' around the mountain when I come. Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment. My clan increase like black unemployment. Yeah, another one dare, G-Gka-Genius. Take us the fuck outta here. The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels. Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel. Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel. Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table. That's what you get when you misuse what I invent. Your empire falls and you lose every cent. For tryna blow up a scrub. Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb. Should've pumped it when I rocked it. Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets. This goes on in some companies. With majors, they're scared to death to pump these. First of all, who's your A&R? A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar? But he don't know the meanin' of dope. When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap. That's cleaner than a bar of soap. And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight.

It's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone. And remember that you feel. I said it's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone. Again I stand, Lord I stand. Against the Faceless Man. Now I saw a face on the water. It looked humble but willing to fight. I saw the will of a warrior. His yoke is easy and his burden is light. He looked me right in the eyes. Direct and concise to remind me. To always do what's right. Again I stand, Lord God I stand. Because if the face inside can't see the light. I know I'll have to walk alone. And if I walk alone to the other side. I know I might not make it home. Next time I see this face. I'll say I choose to live for always. So won't you come inside.

Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets. Now he rest in peace. Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me. So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears. I suffered through the years.

I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse. God, can you feel me? Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain. Show me some happiness again. I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well. I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail? My life is in denial and when I die. Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears. Lord, I suffered through the years. Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears. I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me. My every move is a calculated step. To bring me closer to embrace an early death. Now there's nothin' left. There was no mercy on the streets. I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin'. About to go to pieces, screamin' peace. And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it. I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free. They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame. Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game. No memories, just a misery. Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep. Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun? Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come. Lord! (God!). God, I lost so many peers. And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide. Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die. Wonder why as I walk by. Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high. This ain't the life for me, I wanna change. But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game. I'm trapped inside a maze. See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy. Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies. So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady. Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison. I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys. Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor.

Carnation,Carnation. If you gave me a fresh carnation. I would only crush its tender petals. With me you'll have no escape. And at the same time there'll be nowhere to settle -. I trample down all life in my wake. I eat it up and take the cake. I just avert my eyes to the pain. Of someone's loss helping my gain. If you gave me a dream for my pocket. You'd be plugging in the wrong socket. With me there's no room for the future. With me there's no room with a view at all -. I am out of season all year 'round. Hear machinery roar to my empty sound. Touch my heart and feel winter. Hold my hand and be doomed forever -. And at the same time there'll be nowhere to settle. And if you're wondering by now who I am. Look no further than the mirror -. Because I am the Greed and Fear. And every ounce of Hate in you.,The Jam,Rock,The Gift,,negative
Here You Come Again,Here You Come Again. Here you come again. Just when I'd begun to get myself together. You waltz right in the door. Just like you've done before. And wrap my heart 'round your little finger. Just when I'm about to make it work without you. You look into my eyes. And lie those pretty lies. And pretty soon I'm wondering' how I came to doubt you. All you got to do is smile that smile. And there go all my defenses. Just leave it up to you and in a little while. You're messing' up my mind and filling' up my senses. Looking' better than a body has a right to. And shaking' me up so that all I really know. Is here you come again. And here I go. And shaking' me up so. That all I really know.

Red Shoes,"Red Shoes. I remember as a child. I was absolutely wild. 'Bout some red shoes that my aunt Lucy wore. She would let me stomp around. In those high heels up and down. 'Round the house and 'round the wraparound porch. And from that moment on. I've had a pair of my own. They make me feel at home and brand new. They build my confidence. As if they've been heaven sent. I feel alone, I'm puttin' on my red shoes. I begged mama, ""Pretty please. From the wishbook order me. A pair of red shoes for my feet"", so mama did. Through the years I've thought about. Aunt Lucy's love and think of how. Such little things in life can make or break a kid. I believe that every child. Needs to feel a sense of pride. And someone to love and guide and see them through. So many miles I've traveled. Many times they've come unraveled. On the road both smooth or gravel. But I've made it through, ooh. Hell and half of Georgia. Or walkin' through New Orleans. Walk the streets of Memphis bowlin'. Stroll around a block or two. And if God sees fit to hold me. Anyone that's ever known me. Know I'd walk the gold streets only. In a pair of red shoes. And if I ever get to heaven. If I ever get to heaven. And Lord I hope I do. I will walk the streets of glory. I will tell my Lucy story.

Bored to Death,"Bored to Death. There's an echo pulling out the meaning. Rescuing a nightmare from a dream. The voices in my head are always screaming. That none of this means anything to me. And it's a long way back from seventeen. The whispers turn into a scream. And I... I'm not coming home. Save your breath, I'm nearly. Bored to death and fading fast. Life is too short to last long. Back on earth I'm broken. Lost and cold and fading fast. There's a stranger staring at the ceiling. Rescuing a tiger from a tree. The pictures in her head are always dreaming. Each of them means everything to me. I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down. I said I'm sorry I'm a bit of a let down. But all my friends are daring me to come over. So I come over and over and over. So let me buy you a drink. And we'll pretend that you think. That I'm the man of your dreams. Come to life in a dive bar. And we'll go over and over and over.

'Cause you my nigga, Doc, and Eazy, I'm still with you. Fuck the beef, nigga, I miss you. And that's just being real with you. You see the truth is. Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is. And who I'm still cool with. Then I got these fake-ass niggas I first blew with. Claimin' that they non-violent, talkin' like they. (Do not resist the beat). Spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions. Move units, then talk shit and we can do this. Until then, I ain't even speakin' your name. Just keep my name outta your mouth. And we can keep it the same, nigga. It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors. It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em. That's the difference.

So what the fuck am I supposed to do? I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you. A heartless bastard, high and plastered. My style is like the reaction from too much acid. Never come down, pass it around if you can't handle it. Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates. (What?). About five bank accounts, three ounces, and two vehicles. Until my death, I'm Bangladesh. I suggest you hold yo' breath 'til ain't none left. Yo, that's the difference!. A'ight, hold up, hold up!. Stop the beat a minute, I got somethin' to say, Dre. I wanna tell you this shit right now. While this fuckin' weed is in me (What the fuck?). I don't know if I ever told you this. But I love you, dog, I got your motherfuckin' back.

And have her wavin' at people (Hi!). Then drop her off on the corner at the police station. And drive off honkin' the horn for her. Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off. Drop the sawed off. And beat you with the piece it was sawed off of. Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up. Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up. In they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water. That's for tryin' to talk like The Chronic was lost product. That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up. You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up.

I couldn't take it off if I tried. And the cactus sure tastes strangely sweet. As it goes down inside. I dream I'm safe in my hotel womb. Soft and soul-made, it's a wonderful room. Sudden voltage in the night. With a rain forest girl. As we float downstream to the Amazon River. Where the black waters swirl. I say, why are you people wearing those masks? I say, can we be reconciled? She says the mother of the storm has to roam the sky. Searching for her child. I wish I'm back in my hotel womb. Slip through the crack to that wonderful room. Morning comes at last. And she's lying by my side. She's got the face of the widow who keeps following me. And the body of my bride. I say, why are those buildings swaying like trees?

And the gasoline car is gone. When an airplane flies without any fuel. And sunlight heats our home. One of these days when the air clears up. And the sun come shining through. Eating rainbow stew with a silver spoon. Underneath that sky of blue. You don't have to get high to be happy. Just think about what's in store. When people start doing what they oughta to be doing.

That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight. Quietly he laughs and shaking his head. Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed. And softer than shadow and quicker than flies. His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes. Be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy. Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more. For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light. The Spiderman is having you for dinner tonight. And I feel like I'm being eaten. By a thousand million shivering furry holes.

Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh. His hair'll get you seasick, I sat back and peeped shit. The roll with E-Z Wider and they ain't get blunted.

Slow is the tempo - now talkin' but a nympho. So peep it out here goes the info. This is a bitch that did the whole crew. She get it so much we make bets on who the ho would love to go through. And for the shit that she does, give her a drum roll. Because the dumb bitch licks out the asshole. And she'll let you videotape her. And if you got a gang of niggas, the bitch would let you rape her. She likes suckin' on dicks, and lickin' up nut. And they even take the broomstick up the butt.

She took her tongue out her mouth, put it on top. Like a cherry, started movin' it like a snake and it was very irresistable. I couldn't pay the bitch to quit. Cuz the ho' was doin' some ol' crazy shit. That made me start havin' a fit'. Cuz the bitch sucked a hellified dick. Now one night I was at a drive-in. And a car full of niggas straight drove in. I thought they wuz commin' to start trouble but no. Five niggas in the bucket with the neighborhood ho'. Now what do you expect they're gonna dogg her like a doggy. Thirty minutes later and the windowz all were foggy. And I'm off in my car havin' a fit cuz the bitch that I'm with. Said no fuckin' on the first date, shit. And I'm like Damn! I wish I was in the bucket. To be the sixth nigga with the ho' and I can fuck it. So I told the bitch I was with that I'm goin' to the snack bar. And got the fuck out the car. Went to the bucket and I looked through the window. It was some niggas that I knew they let me in yo. And my turn was like next. I couldn't see her face, all I saw was her pussy and her chest. I wanted to see the face, I felt I oughtta. Peep over the seat, Oh shit! It's the preacher's daughter!. And she's only 14 and a ho'. But the bitch sucks dick like a specialized pro. She looked at me, I was surprised. But wasn't passin' up the chance of my dick gettin' baptized. I told the bitch to do it quick. You little ho' hurry up and suck my dick!. Now I'm a break it down with a fact. Since the last ""Just don't bite it"" girls don't know how to act. Sayin' that they never would suck a dick. But when they've tried it they couldn't quit. Cuz ninety percent of the bitches today they love that shit. And those are the main ones that say they don't do it. But MC Ren knows the bitches are used to it. So fellas, next time they try to tell a lie. That they never suck a dick, punch a bitch in the eye. And then the ho' will fall to the ground. Then you'll open up her mouth. Put your dick in and move the shit around. And she'll catch on and start doin' it on her own. Actin' like she's tryin' to suck the meat off a chicken bone. And then she won't let go. Because bitches suck nut out of a dick just like Drano. Get the last drop, unclogging the pipe. Then the stupid bitch is out doing that same shit the next night. Because she just can't quit.

Child, ya got the best pops anyone could have. Dillon's cool, super hip, you should be glad. Yeah, it seemed that Santa's ways were parallel with Dillon. But when Millie and him got home, he was more of a villain. While she slept in he crept inside her bedroom. And he would toss her and then would force her to give him head room. Millie tried real hard to let this hell not happen. But when she'd fuss, he would just commence the slappin'. (Yo Dillon man, Millie's been out of school for a week, man, what's the deal?). I guess he was givin' Millie's bruises time to heal. Of course he told us she was sick and we believed him. And at the department store as Santa we would see 'em. And as he smiled, his own child was at home plottin'. How off the face of this earth she was gonna knock him. When I got home, I found she had tried to call me. My machine had kicked to her hey how ya doin' (sorry). I tried to call the honey but her line was busy. I guess I'll head to Macy's and bug out on Dillon. I received a call from Misses Sick herself. I asked her how was she recoverin' her health. She said that what she had to ask would make it seem minute. She wanted to talk serious, I said, ""go ahead-shoot"". She claimed I hit the combo dead upon the missile. Wanted to know if I could get a loaded pistol. That ain't a problem but why would Millie need one. She said she wanted her pops Dillon to heed one. Ran some style about him pushin' on her privates. Look honey, I don't care if you kick five fits. There's no way that you can prove to me that Dill's flip. He might breathe a blunt but ya jeans he wouldn't rip. You're just mad he's your overseer at school. No need to play him out like he's someone cruel. She kicked that she would go get it from somewhere else. Yeah, whatever you say, go for ya self. Macy's department store, the scene for Santa's kisses. And all the little brats demandin' all of their wishes. Time passes by as I wait for my younger brother. He asks his wish, I waste no time to return him back to Mother. As I'm jettin', Millie floats in like a zombie. I ask her what's her problem, all she says is ""Where is he?"". I give a point, she pulls a pistol, people screamin'. She shouts to Dill, ""He's off to hell cuz he's a demon!"". None of the kids could understand what was the cause. All they could see was a girl holdin' a pistol on Claus. Dillon pleaded mercy, said he didn't mean to. Do all the things that her mind could do nothing but cling to. Millie bucked him and with the quickness it was over.",De La Soul,Hip-Hop,De La Soul is Dead,1991.0,negative

I'm feeling scared 'cause I'm shouting loud. And no one can hear my voice. I'm walking the tightwire, can't look down. Strung out high, above you all. Fateful wind blows through this land. Howls my name, heralds my fall. All over this wasteland (x2).",The Mission UK,Rock,God’s Own Medicine,,negative

Casey’s Last Ride,"Casey’s Last Ride. Casey joins the hallow sound of silent people walking down. The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below. Following their footsteps through the neon darkened corridors. Of silent desperation never speaking to a soul. The poison air he's breathing has a dirty smell of dying. Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain. But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes. Of the clicking of the turnstyle and the rattle of his chain. Oh she said, Casey it's been so long since I've seen you. Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile. See she said, I put on new stockings just to please you. Lord she said, Casey can you only stay a while. Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the Golden Crown. For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones. Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men. Who reach for anything thay can to keep from going home. Standing in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter. Never glancing in the mirror at the people passin' by. And he stumbles as he's leavin' and he wonders if the reason. Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye. Oh she said, I suppose you seldom think about me. Now she said, now that you've a family of your own. Still she said, it's so blessed good to feel your body.
