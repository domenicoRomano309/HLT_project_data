Heart of Gold,Heart of Gold. I want to live. I want to give. I've been a miner. For a heart of gold. It's these expressions. I never give. That keeps me searching. And I'm getting old.

God’s Gonna Cut You Down,"God’s Gonna Cut You Down. You can run on for a long time. Run on for a long time. Sooner or later, God'll cut you down. Go tell that long tongue liar. Go and tell that midnight rider. Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter. Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down. Well my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news. My head's been wet with the midnight dew. I've been down on bended knee, talkin' to the man from Galilee. He spoke to me in the voice so sweet. I thought I heard the shuffle of the angel's feet. He called my name and my heart stood still. When he said, ""John, go do My will!"". Well, you may throw your rock and hide your hand. Workin' in the dark against your fellow man.

It Was Written,"It Was Written. And it was written. Up in the book of life. That a man shall. Endure forever more. Well did you know the pen. Is stronger than the knife. And they can kill you once. But they can't kill you twice. Did you know destruction of the flesh. Is not the ending to life. Fear not of the anti-christ. Did you know that I. Exist before the earth. And did you know my eyes. Are windows to the world. Did you know you can't go to Zion and wear jerry curls. Can't tell the boys from the girls. Your body's just a vehicle. Transporting yo' soul. It's what's inside ah people. Is beauty to behold. Fear not of evil. Everyday dem flesh it grow old. Changes of the times take the toll. The one ya name, fear is in the eyes of the beholder. And love is in the presence of the love maker. Life is in the words of the comforter. Endure much longer, live much longer. Fear is in the eyes of the beholder. A vest around his chest and Rastafari is his name. The gift of everlasting life for us to all sustain. Blessing that you all begot. Lessons that you all forgot. Rasta call it shit you not. Do you remember Elijah. And his chariot of flames. Same blood that runs thru my veins. Fear is in the eyes of di beholder. Careful how you entertain stranger. Selassie never born inna nuh manger. And I'm never crucify as nuh savior. Elect off himself inna the ruler. Babylon ah nah malfunction well dem a failure. So be careful of dem cellular and pager. Cause I sign see dem I see danger. So dem great but Selaisse I greater. Me think me wanna lick upon shots. Upon a bloodclot. And fill the block with bumbaraas cops. Cops mi dun talk you know you watch me walks in. While black woman is getting raped across New Yorks And. Before another brother's in chalks And. I imagine somebody said that's your son dead, see him? See us we do the crime we do the time. Y'all get away scott-free. So police mi gonna pop you before you pop me. Cause if you get me you got me you shot me. Know'll lot me carry shotty since moms slap me. Cause my room sloppy. The youngest nigga out the camp is me. But nobody pampered me. So you better don't ramp with me. Fi see me, me don't play plenty. Chicks me blazed many. Raised plenty fi dollars. Storm upon mi prada. Watch a bomb holla. Watch 'im run, hit the floor. Told I'm come, come no. Throw ya ganja pon de air. 'plah!'. So watch for sticks and stones, stumbling blocks in piles. Life is one big road, miles on top of miles. So blessed be the soul that always remains a child. When most people don't even smile. There's a natural mystic, blowing tru the air. So keep it realistic, and always be aware. The truth is crying out, and it's so loud and so clear. But most people won't even hear. Spiritual pollution in the atmosphere. And with so much confusion, can one be happy here. The gift of Rastafari is for all man to share. But some would rather to be so unfair.",Damian Marley,Reggae,Halfway Tree,2012.0,negative

Nine While Nine,Nine While Nine. And it's passing strange. And I'm waiting for the train. Caught up on this line again. And it's passing slowly. Killing time. But it's better than living in what will come. And I've still got some of your letters with me. And I Thought sometimes. Or I read too much. And I think you know. Let's drink to the dead lying under the water. And the cost of the blood on the driven snow. And the lipstick on my cigarettes. Frost upon the window pane. Nine while nine and I'm waiting. For the train... She said do you remember a time when angels. Do you remember a time when fear. In the days when I was stronger. In the days when you were here. She said when days had no beginning. While days had no end. When shadows grew no longer. I knew no other friend but you. Were wild. You were wild... Frost upon these cigarettes. Lipstick on the window pane.

That Summer,"That Summer. I went to work for her that summer. A teenage kid so far from home. She was a lonely widow woman. Hell-bent to make it on her own. We were a thousand miles from nowhere. Wheat fields as far as I could see. Both needing somethin' from each other. Not knowin' yet what that might be. 'Til she came to me one evenin'. Hot cup of coffee and a smile. In a dress that I was certain. She hadn't worn in quite a while. There was a difference in her laughter. There was a softness in her eyes. And on the air there was a hunger. Even a boy could recognize. She had a need to feel the thunder. To chase the lightnin' from the sky. To watch a storm with all its wonder. Ragin' in her lover's eyes. She had to ride the heat of passion. Like a comet burnin' bright. Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been. Burnin' both ends of the night. That summer wind was all around me. Nothin' between us but the night. And when I told her that I'd never. She softly whispered that's alright. And then I watched her hands of leather. Turn to velvet in a touch. There's never been another summer. When I have ever learned so much. We had a need to feel the thunder. Ragin' in each others eyes. We had to ride the heat of passion. I often think about that summer. The sweat, the moonlight and the lace. And I have rarely held another. When I haven't seen her face. And every time I pass a wheat field. And watch it dancin' with the wind. Although I know it isn't real, I just can't help but feel. Her hungry arms again.",Garth Brooks,Country,The Chase,1993.0,positive

Don't cross him, don't boss him. He's wild in his sorrow. He's riding and hiding his pain. Don't fight him, don't spite him. Just wait 'til tomorrow. Maybe he'll ride on again.

The yellow-haired lady came down to the tavern. And looked up the stranger there. He bought her a drink and he gave her some money. He just didn't seem to care. She followed him out as he saddled his stallion. And laughed as she grabbed at the bay. He shot her so quick, they had no time to warn her. She never heard anyone say. ""Don't cross him, don't boss him. ""He's wild in his sorrow. ""He's riding and hiding his pain. ""Don't fight him, don't spite him. ""Just wait 'til tomorrow. ""Maybe he'll ride on again"". The yellow-haired lady was buried at sunset. The stranger went free, of course. For you can't hang a man for killing a woman. Who's trying to steal your horse. This is the tale of the red headed stranger. And if he should pass your way. Stay out of the path of the raging black stallion. And don't lay a hand on the bay.",Willie Nelson,Country,Red Headed Stranger,1975.0,negative
To Be In Your Eyes,"To Be In Your Eyes. Night-time is so lonely. When you hear a sound. But it's only an empty heart. Beating on through the night. A sad sad drum. And I'm lying here listening. And the raindrops are all glistening. In my dreams. And it seems. That the sun never comes. And I want my sad reflection. To go drifting through the skies. To be in your eyes. And I'm waking to this aching. And it's breaking me in two. All the space. All the waste. All the distance between me and you. And the people with their voices. Random choices will they ever learn. To really see. Really be on fire when their spirit burns. I want the person inside me. To be someone I'd recognize. If he was in your eyes. So I'm waiting, contemplating. Relocating a faded image in my thoughts. But the memories are like clouds. Try so hard. But they never can be caught. But I'm trying, yes I'm trying. But I'm only lying in the dark. So alone. On my own. No one home. And if love was worth a fortune. Then I'd need a rise. I want these words to be the things. I hoped you'd realized.",The Church,Rock,The Blurred Crusade,,negative

And tell her she can have it all. Today. Pass the crystal spread the Tarot. In illusion comfort lies. The safest way the straight and narrow. No confusion no surprise.

Coat of Many Colors,"Coat of Many Colors. Back through the years. I go wondering once again. Back to the seasons of my youth. I recall a box of rags that someone gave us. And how my mama put the rags to use. There were rags of many colors. Every piece was small. And I didn't have a coat. And it was way down in the fall. Mama sewed the rags together. Sewing every piece with love. She made my coat of many colors. That I was so proud of. As she sewed, she told a story. From the bible, she had read. About a coat of many colors. Joseph wore and then she said. Perhaps this coat will bring you. Good luck and happiness. And I just couldn't wait to wear it. And momma blessed it with a kiss. My coat of many colors. That my mama made for me. Made only from rags. But I wore it so proudly. Although we had no money. I was rich as I could be. In my coat of many colors. My mama made for me. So with patches on my britches. Holes in both my shoes. I hurried off to school. Just to find the others laughing. And making fun of me. And oh I couldn't understand it. For I felt I was rich. And I told them of the love. My mama sewed in every stitch. And I told them all the story. Mama told me while she sewed. And how my coat of many colors. Was worth more than all their clothes. But they didn't understand it. And I tried to make them see. That one is only poor. Only if they choose to be. Now I know we had no money. But I was rich as I could be.

The Message,"The Message. This one is for my brother, Tyree, R.I.P. A message to God. Since you finishing em early, what possessed you to start him? We made a vow - later we'll regret til death do us part. Lord, I thought we was made for each other. You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other. Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was. I'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you. You knew what you was doing when you made us, so with all due respect. You coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him. He can take the game with him, cause he defines the word. The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it? I'm feeling like my whole world is blinded, wondering why. Crying, pouring out my heart, pouring out liquor behind it. We fought like brothers, something we never should do. We coulda used time spent arguing telling the truth. He had talent too - I had plans on watching him blow. Don't know what hurts more, seeing him leave, or watching him go. Listen, listen, listen (Listen). Listen, listen, listen (Better listen). Listen, listen, listen. Listen. If you wan' know why (Why I live my life). The way that I do (Cause I got to get this money). So don't worry about me (Cause I know my way around). I'm just hustlin' everyday, runnin' this race, makin' this paper. You's a soldier, you're probably packing heat up there. Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there. If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew. I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm going through it with you. We lost a thug, a son, and a father. I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him. The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file. Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial. Prayin' you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt. You either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it. I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keeping a poker face. To straight breaking down and showing all emotions. I'm anxious to believing real G's don't cry. If that's the truth, then I'm realizing I ain't no gangsta. It's just not me, but you know I'mma always ride wit you. I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died with you. [Listen, listen, listen (Listen). Listen](7469635). If you don't know why I you gotta listen up right now. Listen, listen, listen, listen. Listen, listen. Listen, listen, children, listen. I'm tryin to tell you somethin' good. Don't get caught up in the hood, yeah. If you don't know why. You gotta find out the reason why. Brother, brother. Oh, you're Doctor Dre.

Rollin’ With My Homies,"Rollin’ With My Homies. Saturday morning, take the train for a ride. The sun is up, I got my homies by my side. Rollin' down the street with my sixteen speakers.

Block,"Block. I was down in the city on a miracle street. I flailed like a swimmer through the summer heat. I was waiting for a friend that I needed to meet. And I's hoping she was bringing with her something sweet. And I's hoping for an open little opening. And I suffer for a groovy little happening. But it's all going wrong just like I sing in that song. The song that I wrote about you that they put on TV. The TV that I gave you cuz you wanted to see. But all they saw were spaces where the people used to be. A hundred bastard voids with their pull on me. In the valley of death you'll be breathless and free. You'll be dancing like a fool by the swollen sea. You'll be twitching like a drunk in a pharmacy. You'll be swatting at the flies in your pavilion. Where the millionaire just blew a gazillion. The finger nails are all hot vermilion. And the traffic grinds down to a stand-still-ion. And the mynah birds are pecking at the carrion. And you read it already in Hyperion. And you read about my trial in the Clarion. A sack full of ashes I've been carry'n. When the lights turn green I dissolve the screen. When the lights turn red I put the whole thing to bed. Well I've got a fever. And I'm feeling fainter. I'm a dim receiver. I'm a Cold War painter. If you can just hold still. I will make you all so beautiful. When the lights turn blue I know what to do. I'll drown my tomorrows in an ocean or two. And the pretty little things with their magnets and rings. Blooming like a flower through a series of springs. Thank you Fate and the freight that she brings. Thank you Fortuna and that song that she sings. Thank you to my manager for letting me live. Thank you to my friends and the friends that you're with. Thank you to the lord who created all of this. There's a whole lot of hurt before you get to the bliss. Why even Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss. But that was long before that he got in show biz. Well I understand the land, and the land ain't no sea. But when I try to walk I'm sinking you see. So I got a fever.

If Today Was Your Last Day,"If Today Was Your Last Day. My best friend gave me the best advice. He said each day's a gift and not a given right. Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind. And try to take the path less traveled by. That first step you take is the longest stride. (What if, what if?). If today was your last day. And tomorrow was too late. Could you say goodbye to yesterday? Would you live each moment like your last? Leave old pictures in the past? Donate every dime you have? (If today was your last day). Against the grain should be a way of life. What's worth the prize is always worth the fight. Every second counts 'cause there's no second try. So live like you'll never live it twice. Don't take the free ride in your own life. And would you call old friends you never see? Reminisce old memories? Would you forgive your enemies? Would you find that one you're dreamin' of? Swear up and down to God above. That you finally fall in love? (That you finally fall in love). Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart? You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars. Regardless of who you are. So do whatever it takes (Takes). 'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life. Let nothin' stand in your way (Way).

Pound the floor, and scream His name. 'Cause we're still worth saving. Can't go on like this, and live like this. We can't love like this. We gotta give this world. Back to God. Have you lost a love? Do you feel like giving up? Has your heart been broken? Are your kids okay? Will they come home safe? Do you lie there hoping? You can make a wish. You can knock on wood. Ohh, it won't do no good.

Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what. Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though."". Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose. But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms. Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose. But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose. ""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"". And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss. And that's the message that we deliver to little kids. And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is. Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is. By the time they hit fourth grade. They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they? We ain't nothin' but mammalswell, some of us, cannibals. Who cut other people open like cantaloupes. But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes. Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope. But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote. Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes. I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady. All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating. So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up?

So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears? Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs. So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst. And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first. Little bitch put me on blast on MTV. ""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee."". I should download her audio in MP3. And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!). I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups. All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you. And there's a million of us just like me. Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me. Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me. And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me. I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you. Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room. The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all. And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all. I just get on the mic and spit it. And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it. Better than 90% of you rappers out can.

Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens. And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working. And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking. He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings. Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!"". With his windows down and his system up.

I know none of the guys been in... we don't get in love, right? Oh! Let this black man right here tell what his idea of love is, 'cause not all the time we hear a young black man talk about love. About your personal definition, don't tell me what Webster thinks. Huh? Willingness to do everything for that person. Okay, everything like what? Explain. Let him talk c'mon. If I asked him to talk about a fancy car, he'd be right on point. But we wanna talk about love. You can do it. (To another pupil) What do you think? You said you love somebody, you should know why you love them right? The way they act. Uh-huh. The way they carry themselves, stuff like that. Okay. The way that they hang with they boys, and they just stand out. It's like sometimes it don't even matter like what they wear or what they look like. It's like, that way, you know? Yeah. It's like you know you want to talk to him, because he stands out, it's like he got a glow or something. That's deep. That's what I'm talking about. I thought that was a beautiful point. Anyone else want to deal with that? It's sometimes, like when they try to act funny in front of they boys, like when they get around say they love you. They can't love you.

Beyond the Pale,"Beyond the Pale. Cold still waters running deep. Pale before the eyes. Ravaged. By the hands that feed. Thunder clouds the skies. Drifting with the tide. Floating with the stream. The howling winds have gathered strength. From a whisper to a scream. Sell me down the river. And out to sea. Cast me adrift and set me to sail. Just on last kiss before raising hell. Beyond the pale. Heed to Neptune's calling deceived in fable and lore. Learn from treacherous bibles. Of murder, hate and war. Searching for the tears. In an ocean of rain. The yearning of the raging sea beckons once again. Gathering of the storm. And the winds are blowing wild. Sweeping over cross and creed, country, colour and child. Mother Nature cries for love. Her children lost at sea. And as the waves take me away. Say a prayer for liberty.",The Mission UK,Rock,Children,,negative

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box? They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot. But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes. I got a laptop in my back pocket. My pen'll go off when I half-cock it. Got a fat knot from that rap profit. Made a livin' and a killin' off it. Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office. With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack. I'm an MC still as honest. But as rude and as indecent as all hell. Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with). This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop. You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match. With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'. Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack. And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that. I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table. Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half. Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact. How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs. Feel my wrath of attack. Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad. It's actually disastrously bad for the wack. While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as. 'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard. Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like have got. Well, to be truthful the blueprint's. Simply rage and youthful exuberance. Everybody loves to root for a nuisance. Hit the Earth like an asteroid. Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!). MCs get taken to school with this music. 'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme"". Now I lead a new school full of students. Me? I'm a product of Rakim. Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren. Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim. Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position. To meet RunD.M.C., induct them. Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames. Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame. On the wall of shame. You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames. Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'? Little gay-lookin' boy. So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!). You're witnessin' a massacre. Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy. ""Oy vey, that boy's gay! ""that's all they say, lookin' boy. You get a thumbs up, pat on the back. And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy. Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy? I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy. I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit. Get outta my face, lookin' boy!. Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable. Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause. The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR. Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God. Kneel before General Zod. This planet's Kryptonno, Asgard, Asgard. So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin. You rodent, I'm omnipotent. Let off, then I'm reloadin'. Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'. And I should not be woken. I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'. But I got your mom deep-throatin'. I'm out my Ramen Noodle. We have nothin' in common, poodle. I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil. It's me, my honesty's brutal. But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though. For good at least once in a while. So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes. To maybe try to help get some people through tough times. But I gotta keep a few punchlines. Just in case 'cause even you unsigned. Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime. I know there was a time where once I. Was king of the underground. But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind. So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine. Appeal with the skin color of mine. You get too big and here they come tryin'. To censor you like that one line. I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I. Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine. Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9. See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm. Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal. You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though. And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for. You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows. You write normal? Fuck being normal!. And I just bought a new raygun from the future. Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad. 'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad. Singin' to a man while he played piano. Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel. So Ray J went straight to the radio station. The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"". Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad). Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human. What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman? Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and. I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating. How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating. Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting. For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating. 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated. I make elevating music, you make elevator music. ""Oh, he's too mainstream."". Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it. ""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""'cause I found a hella way to fuse it. With rock, shock rap with Doc. Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it. ""I don't know how to make songs like that. I don't know what words to use."". Let me know when it occurs to you. While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you. It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you. How many verses I gotta murder to. Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!. Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie. But look at the accolades these skills brung me. Full of myself, but still hungry. I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to. And I'm a million leagues above you. Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you. I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel. I'ma sleep in the front seat. Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky"". But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling. Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me. They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate. But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred. I have, then you may be a little patient. And more sympathetic to the situation. And understand the discrimination. But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!. But if I can't batter the women. How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!. Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake.

Can't change how you feel, 'cause it's all on you, woah, oh, yeah. I wish that, you could be a little bit more upfront. Weigh the situation how you want (right). The loving that you claim is just a four letter word. The third letter's inviting so visualize the verb. You curve thought waves when you're handling the candelabra. So you sitting on the baby grand. Transmitting like you're made of man. But you paint a funny face like a chick. When I see you I'ma tell you quick that uhh. I can't believe we built this large pizza pie together. No pepperoni.

Niggas who cut us off, wanna reattach us now. (Them girls who brushed us off, say they want some #'s to dial). Yeah I give that ass a number, and some lumber to pile. Now catch a curve from my kick (or show me loving by brick). So stick to the same plan, don't come shaking my hand. Like we peeps, it ain't beef but be sure to understand. Between us, it ain't all. You see them kids be scheming on what we done copped. Always out there scheming!. They steady fiending for the moment they can get us off the block. Why they always fiending? Your people might have your back, but you need to watch your front. Indeed, ain't nothing guaranteed. That's the truth! Things ain't goin' like you think they should. A lot say they wanna walk in my size 10's. Alright then; here's a pair. Lace 'em up tight then you might feel what was dealt to me. You see ain't no young boys up in here; keep a clear head.

I inspect you through the future see millennium. Killa Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum. Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics. Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths. Black Wu jackets, Queen Beez ease the guns in. Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function. Heads by the score take flight, incite a war. Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more. Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly. Proceeds to blow, swinging swords like Shinobi. Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock. Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block. As the world turns, I spread like germ. Bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard-headed never learn. This my testament to those burned.

When I'm rolling real slow and the lights out. 'Cause I'm about to fuck up the program. Shooting out the window of a drop-top Brougham. When I'm shooting, let's see who drop. The police, the media, and suckers that went pop? And motherfuckers that say they too black. Put 'em overseas, they be begging to come back. And say we promote gangs and drugs.

About as much as the Bicentennial. I don't give a fuck about dissing these fools. 'Cause they all scared of the Ice Cube. And what I say, what I portray and all that. And ain't even seen the gat. I don't wanna see no dancing. I'm sick of that shit -- listen to the hit. 'Cause yo if I look and see another brother. On the video trying to out-dance each other. I'ma tell T-Bone to pass the bottle. And don't give me that shit about role model. It ain't wise to chastise and preach. Just open the eyes of each. 'Cause laws are made to be broken up.

Sometimes the Brightest Light Comes From the Darkest Place,Sometimes the Brightest Light Comes From the Darkest Place. Put the black crepe and the coolin' board away. Take the bunting down I ain't leaving town today. The choice is yours and so is the consequence. You don't win no medal for sitting on the fence. Sometime the warmest smile comes from the saddest face. Sometimes the brightest light comes from the darkest place. Don't talk of ghosts while the sun still shines. There's gold aplenty waiting in the mines. I have no fear of death but I am scared of dying. And the heaven they are selling I just ain't buying. Sometimes the truest kiss comes with a whore's embrace. Sleep is for dreamers and dreaming is for fools. If you've got guilt to carry then know carrying's for mules. It's the fate of man to live not as God. Whoever wrote the book was such a silly sod. Sometimes the fastest thrill comes from the longest chase. Death never takes the wise man by surprise. But who here among us can call themselves wise. God whispers in my ear that my halo is aflame. It's too easy to look for someone else to blame.

Now try to catch (Now try to catch me). Kill everybody cause I'm gunning outta stress. If I'm running outta breath, he gonna pick up where I left off. Keep him with me when he spitting cause the flow be the bidness. I'm a menace when I bust a lyrical tec off. Go faster than Ricky Bobby, kill him in Talladega Nights. Niggas try to get up, when a nigga hit up. When it I come I promise you gotta pay the price. Look, why don't everybody wanna come and try get a little taste. Of the shit I got, let me put it all up in your face. When I spit it I got a nigga wilding all over the place. Everybody better listen here. Cause you know when I bring him I will never, never stop. Make a nigga rewind and bring it back to the top. Throw the shit up in the streets and I be running every block. Everybody better stand clear. Like a millimeter when I be booking the track up. Motivated for murder whenever I act up. A couple of phenomenal niggas can stack up. Gets anybody that wanna live in the back up. Killing everybody when I bust a clip off. Cause I'mma be attacking them with the insane flow. Then I be having them calling me Twista Phelps. And my nigga Buss like Usain Bolt. Shocked a nigga like I was a thousand volts. Now I'm sailing on the beat the way I'm sailing on the boat. The way I gotta kill 'em and the way I gotta flow. You don't really wanna test me, boy, cause I'll pop ya. When I'm in the spot you know you can't leave. I spit every word 'till, damn I can't breathe. You never heard 'till you nosebleed. Twista, please. Now you know I got ya. You can talk about it with a bunch of people. That say that I'm a lyrical manifestation of rhythem. Then I come and do the shit I gotta do and then I bang 'em. And get 'em and do it every single time I hit 'em. When I do it its gotta be accurate. Like I'm attacking the rhythm with such a vocal tenacity. See the way a brother blacking I'm back and infant. Cause every time we in the place you feeling the capacity. I be coming with it, he be coming with it. And nobody really do it how we do it. And the flow is so fluid I gotta be an anomaly. Gotta be an Odyssey; the prodigy, and I'mma be the one to prove it. Don't you ever forget it the way we coming. And they sending somebody, gonna probably be needing a medic. So give us the credit and I thought that we should oughta. Be coming to slaughter so call out the order see the way we do it.",Busta Rhymes,Hip-Hop,,2011.0,negative
What A Friend We Have In Jesus,What A Friend We Have In Jesus. What a friend we have in Jesus. All our sins and griefs to bear!. What a privilege to carry. Everything to God in prayer!. O what peace we often forfeit. O what needless pain we bear. All because we do not carry. Everything to God in prayer. Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere? We should never be discouraged;. Take it to the Lord in prayer. Can we find a friend so faithful. Who will all our sorrows share? Jesus knows our every weakness.,Alan Jackson,Country,Precious Memories,2006.0,negative
