Millie Pulled a Pistol on Santa,"""If you will suck my soul I will lick your funky emotions""  This is the stylin' for a title that sounds silly But nothin' silly about the triflin' times of Millie Millie a Brooklyn Queen originally from Philly Complete with that accent that made her sound hillbilly Around this time the slammin' joint was “Milk is Chillin'” But even cooler was my social worker Dillon Yeah I had a social worker 'cuz I had some troubles Anyone who'd riff on me, I'd pop their dome like bubbles He'd bring me to his crib to watch my favorite races That's how his daughter Millie became one of my favorite faces She had the curves that made you wanna take chances I mean on her, man, I'd love to make advances I guess her father must 'a got the same feelin' I mean, actually findin' his own daughter Millie appealing At the time no one knew but it was a shame That Millie became a victim of the touchy-touchy game  Yo Millie, what's the problem, lately you've been buggin' On your dookie earrings, someone must be tuggin' You were a dancer who could always be found clubbin' Now you're world renowned with the frown you're luggin' Come to think your face look stink when Dill's around you He's your father-what done happen-did he ground you? You shouldn't flip on him 'cuz Dill is really cool Matter of fact, the coolest elder in the school He hooked up a trip to bring us all the Lacey He volunteered to play old Santa Claus at Macy's Child, ya got the best pops anyone could have Dillon's cool, super hip, you should be glad  Yeah, it seemed that Santa's ways were parallel with Dillon But when Millie and him got home, he was more of a villain While she slept in he crept inside her bedroom And he would toss her and then would force her to give him head room Millie tried real hard to let this hell not happen But when she'd fuss, he would just commence the slappin' (Yo Dillon man, Millie's been out of school for a week, man, what's the deal?) I guess he was givin' Millie's bruises time to heal Of course he told us she was sick and we believed him And at the department store as Santa we would see 'em And as he smiled, his own child was at home plottin' How off the face of this earth she was gonna knock him When I got home, I found she had tried to call me My machine had kicked to her hey how ya doin' (sorry) I tried to call the honey but her line was busy I guess I'll head to Macy's and bug out on Dillon  I received a call from Misses Sick herself I asked her how was she recoverin' her health She said that what she had to ask would make it seem minute She wanted to talk serious, I said, ""go ahead-shoot"" She claimed I hit the combo dead upon the missile Wanted to know if I could get a loaded pistol That ain't a problem but why would Millie need one She said she wanted her pops Dillon to heed one Ran some style about him pushin' on her privates Look honey, I don't care if you kick five fits There's no way that you can prove to me that Dill's flip He might breathe a blunt but ya jeans he wouldn't rip You're just mad he's your overseer at school No need to play him out like he's someone cruel She kicked that she would go get it from somewhere else Yeah, whatever you say, go for ya self  Macy's department store, the scene for Santa's kisses And all the little brats demandin' all of their wishes Time passes by as I wait for my younger brother He asks his wish, I waste no time to return him back to Mother As I'm jettin', Millie floats in like a zombie I ask her what's her problem, all she says is ""Where is he?"" I give a point, she pulls a pistol, people screamin' She shouts to Dill, “He's off to hell cuz he's a demon!” None of the kids could understand what was the cause All they could see was a girl holdin' a pistol on Claus Dillon pleaded mercy, said he didn't mean to Do all the things that her mind could do nothing but cling to Millie bucked him and with the quickness it was over",De La Soul,Hip-Hop,De La Soul is Dead,1991.0,negative

Sometimes the Brightest Light Comes From the Darkest Place,Put the black crepe and the coolin' board away Take the bunting down I ain't leaving town today The choice is yours and so is the consequence You don't win no medal for sitting on the fence Sometime the warmest smile comes from the saddest face Sometimes the brightest light comes from the darkest place Don't talk of ghosts while the sun still shines There's gold aplenty waiting in the mines I have no fear of death but I am scared of dying And the heaven they are selling I just ain't buying Sometimes the truest kiss comes with a whore´s embrace Sometimes the brightest light comes from the darkest place Sleep is for dreamers and dreaming is for fools If you've got guilt to carry then know carrying's for mules It's the fate of man to live not as God Whoever wrote the book was such a silly sod Sometimes the fastest thrill comes from the longest chase Sometimes the brightest light comes from the darkest place Death never takes the wise man by surprise But who here among us can call themselves wise God whispers in my ear that my halo is aflame It's too easy to look for someone else to blame Sometimes the weakest man fights with the strongest faith Sometimes the biggest prizes comes from the shortest race Sometimes the slightest sigh fills up the biggest space Sometimes the brightest light comes from the darkest place,The Mission UK,Rock,The Brightest Light,,negative

Niggas don't know how to act in a drought See, baby girl, I realized My definition of a real nigga was skewed My views misshaped by new mixtapes That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops And the cyclical nature of doing time continues My worst fear is one day that you come home from school And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true But maybe there's a chance that it's not And this album remains locked In a hard drive like valuable jewels And I can teach you this in person Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you For your eyes only  For your eyes, for your eyes only For your eyes, for your eyes only For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes only  One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice And it was chilling, he said: ""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children I never asked for nothing, when times was hard I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me I dealt with the repercussions of my actions I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit But that shit was in my blood, you know my life I know your momma, nigga, send my love In case I never get a chance to speak again I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib That's the way I wished my family lived But my granny crib was in the 'jects"" I had to interject like: ""Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"" He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions But I been having premonitions Just call it visions from the other side I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow Like the time I'm living on is borrowed With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father Write my story down, and if I pass Go play it for my daughter when she ready"" And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son I dedicate these words to you and all the other children Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation That sent your pops to prison when he needed education Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better Although I know that means that I would never Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old Now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold Not because he was the first To get some pussy 12 years old Not because he used to come through In the Caddy on some vogues Not because he went from bagging up Them grams to serving O's Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law"" Although that was true Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you For your eyes only",J.

How not to go against me, smart And it's absurd how people hang on every word I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first ‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static? ‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest, so  'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high?
