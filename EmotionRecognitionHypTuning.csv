Every now and then I step to the now. For now I see back then I might have acted like a fool. Now I won't apologize for it. This is not a bunch of Bradys. But a bunch of black man's pride. Yet I can safely say. I've never played a sister by touching where her private parts reside. I've always walked the right side of the road. If I wasn't making song I wouldn't be a thug selling drugs. But a man with a plan. And if I was a rug cleaner. Betcha Pos'd have the cleanest rugs I am. The Plug Two brand with the flavour. In the flute watch the sniffin'. So a sack of shows in demand. I read the diction from the second page. I got the one-two gauge. Baritone to the izm fan. Trees fall so I can play ground with my ink. So let me need ya to my ems go. I push the infinite and carry it. My carrier's the three over one. So my pluggins already know. Lick shots with moo. Catch the boo. From a ghost in the heckling crowd. If I give a foot. Jack Ville caught a spill. When a still came from my mouth. I brought a head down south. I don't check for the noose and the neck. So I never tell my ems. That finesse is knocking at my door. I choose to run from the rays of the burning sun. And dodge a needle washing up upon a sandy shore. I bring the element H with the 2. So ya owe me what's coming when I'm raining on your new parade. It's just mind over matter. And what matters is. That the mind isn't guided by the punished shade. I keep the walking on the right side. But I won't judge the next who handles walking on the wrong. Cuz that's how he wants to be. No difference, see. I wanna be like the name of this song I am. The deeds of a natural. Are seeds that are no longer planted. So the famine in the mind is strong. Tactics of another plane is now proven sane. Sane enough to let you know from within this song. I stabilize many cableized viewers. So my occupation's known. But not why I occupy. And that is to bring the peace. Not in the flower but the As-Salaam Alaikum in the third I am.",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot. But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes. I got a laptop in my back pocket. My pen'll go off when I half-cock it. Got a fat knot from that rap profit. Made a livin' and a killin' off it. Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office. With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack. I'm an MC still as honest. But as rude and as indecent as all hell. Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with). This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop. You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match. With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'. Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack. And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that. I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table. Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half. Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact. How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs. Feel my wrath of attack. Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad. It's actually disastrously bad for the wack. While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as. 'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard. Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like have got. Well, to be truthful the blueprint's. Simply rage and youthful exuberance. Everybody loves to root for a nuisance. Hit the Earth like an asteroid. Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!). MCs get taken to school with this music. 'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme"".

Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause. The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR. Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God. Kneel before General Zod. This planet's Kryptonno, Asgard, Asgard. So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin. You rodent, I'm omnipotent. Let off, then I'm reloadin'. Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'. And I should not be woken. I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'. But I got your mom deep-throatin'. I'm out my Ramen Noodle. We have nothin' in common, poodle. I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil. It's me, my honesty's brutal. But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though. For good at least once in a while. So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes. To maybe try to help get some people through tough times. But I gotta keep a few punchlines. Just in case 'cause even you unsigned. Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime. I know there was a time where once I. Was king of the underground. But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind. So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine. Appeal with the skin color of mine. You get too big and here they come tryin'. To censor you like that one line. I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I. Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine. Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9. See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm. Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal. You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though. And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for. You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows. You write normal? Fuck being normal!. And I just bought a new raygun from the future. Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad. 'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad. Singin' to a man while he played piano. Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel. So Ray J went straight to the radio station. The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"". Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad). Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human. What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman? Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and. I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating. How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating. Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting. For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating. 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated. I make elevating music, you make elevator music. ""Oh, he's too mainstream."". Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it. ""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""'cause I found a hella way to fuse it. With rock, shock rap with Doc. Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it. ""I don't know how to make songs like that. I don't know what words to use."". Let me know when it occurs to you. While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you. It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you. How many verses I gotta murder to. Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!. Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie. But look at the accolades these skills brung me. Full of myself, but still hungry. I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to. And I'm a million leagues above you. Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you. I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel. I'ma sleep in the front seat. Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky"". But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling. Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me. They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate. But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred. I have, then you may be a little patient. And more sympathetic to the situation. And understand the discrimination. But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!. But if I can't batter the women. How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!. Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake.

Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler. I show you the ropes, connect the dots. A country girl that love Hollywood. Mama used to cook red beans and rice. Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite. Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection. Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians. R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers. Music and iPhone cameras. This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think. That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean. He flew you in this motherfucker on first class. Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag. Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math? That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck. She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper. I said baby, ""Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards"". You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence. Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is.

The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek. The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee. And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets. Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity. And yeah, G, I was all for it. She said, ""K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet"".

Friday night, tryna make it into the city. Breakneck speeds, passenger seatsomethin' pretty. Thinking back to how I got here in the first place. Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base. A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds. And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs. Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous. When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list. Strippers get invited to where they only got hired. When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired. I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired. And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir. Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary. I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries. For all my niggas with babies by bitches. That use they kids as meal tickets. Not knowin' the disconnect from the father. The next generation will be the real victims. I can't fault 'em, really. I remember Amber told my boy.

You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'. I be thinkin' every day. Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades. I be paranoid every time, the pressure. The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'. My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired. First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died. Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive. That's why I'd rather take the 405. I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim. But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him. Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents. What I'm supposed to do? Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints? Every agent I know, know I hate agents. I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant. Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance. It's just me, I do it my way, bitch. Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans. If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans. I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again. But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans. A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems. Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it. It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out. And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out. Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam. Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam. Thank God for me! (Los Angeles). Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!. I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful. Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful. I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes.

Solid as a rock, small piece of leather but well put together. Flames are endeavors. Time to find out that gain makes it better. Pain makes it better. Shades of epiphany, can't let it get to me. Move so differently, do it so swiftly. Ease into my style, lay mine down. King be crowned, look at me now. Teaching my classes by the masses. Used to gang bang, used to love the clashes. Now cash is the only motivation. But not for me G, I'm into public relations. That's food for your, De La Soul, word to the letter. (I heard my nana say it say). The bigger the headache, bigger the pill. The harder you fall, stronger the will. We came from the back of the bus, talking Watts to Mobile. Now we're on a house on a hill.

'Cause I ain't mad at cha. Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there. Kickin' up dust, givin' a motherfuck. Yeah, niggas, 'cause I ain't mad at cha. Now we was once two niggas of the same kind. Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line. You was just a little smaller, but you still rolled. Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll. 'Member when you had a Jheri Curl, didn't quite learn. On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm. Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed. Oh, you a Muslim now? No more dope game. Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail. Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail. It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man. Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan. When I talk about money, all you see is the struggle. When I tell you I'm livin' large, you tell me it's trouble. Congratulations on the weddin', I hope your wife know. She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'. I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember. I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her. And I can see us after school, we'd bomb. On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on. Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it. Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it.

Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs. I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared. Besides bumpin' and grindin', wasn't nothin' on our mind. In time, we'd learned to live a life of crime. Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know. I caught a felony, lovin' the way the guns blow. And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait. Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state. I kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes. Said I'll return but I gotta fight, the fate's arrived. Don't shed a tear, 'cause Mama, I ain't happy here. I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years. They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs. In my cell, thinkin', ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back"". As soon as I touch down. I told my girl I'd be there, so prepare to get fucked down. The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha. 'Cause you's a down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha.

He went from nothin' to lots, ten carats to rock. Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block. He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's. Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury. See, first you was our nigga, but you made it so the choice is made. Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days. So full of pain while the weapons blaze. Gettin' so high off that bomb, hopin' we make it to the better days. 'Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze. You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days. So many changed on me, so many tried to plot. That I keep a Glock beside my head, when will it stop? 'Til God return me to my essence. 'Cause even as an adolescent, I refused to be a convalescent. So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down. I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now? They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha.

Desire lurks beyond good and evil. So I dance on the graves where the hallowed fall. Over this land. All over this wasteland. You can touch, but please keep your distance. You're innocent and pure and with no shame. The spirit is willing, and the flesh is craved. You tease and you taunt with the pleasure of pain. Heaven and Hell, I know them well.

Smile and grin at the change all around. Pick up my guitar and play. Just like yesterday. And I'll get on my knees and pray. We don't get fooled again. Don't get fooled again. Change it had to come. We knew it all along. We were liberated from the fold that's all. But the world looks just the same. And history ain't changed. Cause the banners, they all flown in the last war. Take a vow for the new revolution. No, no!. I'll move myself and my family aside. If we happen to be left half alive. I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky. For I know that the hypnotized never lie. Do ya? There's nothing in the street. Looks any different to me. And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye. And the parting on the left. Is now the parting on the right. And the beards have all grown longer overnight. Then I'll get on my knees and pray. YEAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Meet the new boss.

Mama sewed the rags together. Sewing every piece with love. She made my coat of many colors. That I was so proud of. As she sewed, she told a story. From the bible, she had read. About a coat of many colors. Joseph wore and then she said. Perhaps this coat will bring you. Good luck and happiness. And I just couldn't wait to wear it. And momma blessed it with a kiss. My coat of many colors. That my mama made for me. Made only from rags. But I wore it so proudly. Although we had no money. I was rich as I could be. In my coat of many colors. My mama made for me. So with patches on my britches. Holes in both my shoes. I hurried off to school. Just to find the others laughing. And making fun of me. And oh I couldn't understand it. For I felt I was rich. And I told them of the love. My mama sewed in every stitch. And I told them all the story. Mama told me while she sewed. And how my coat of many colors. Was worth more than all their clothes.

Damian Marley,Reggae,It Was Written,Halfway Tree,2012.0,"It Was Written. And it was written. Up in the book of life. That a man shall. Endure forever more. Well did you know the pen. Is stronger than the knife. And they can kill you once. But they can't kill you twice. Did you know destruction of the flesh. Is not the ending to life. Fear not of the anti-christ. Did you know that I. Exist before the earth. And did you know my eyes. Are windows to the world. Did you know you can't go to Zion and wear jerry curls. Can't tell the boys from the girls. Your body's just a vehicle. Transporting yo' soul. It's what's inside ah people. Is beauty to behold. Fear not of evil. Everyday dem flesh it grow old. Changes of the times take the toll. The one ya name, fear is in the eyes of the beholder. And love is in the presence of the love maker. Life is in the words of the comforter. Endure much longer, live much longer. Fear is in the eyes of the beholder. A vest around his chest and Rastafari is his name. The gift of everlasting life for us to all sustain. Blessing that you all begot. Lessons that you all forgot. Rasta call it shit you not. Do you remember Elijah. And his chariot of flames. Same blood that runs thru my veins. Fear is in the eyes of di beholder. Careful how you entertain stranger. Selassie never born inna nuh manger. And I'm never crucify as nuh savior. Elect off himself inna the ruler. Babylon ah nah malfunction well dem a failure. So be careful of dem cellular and pager. Cause I sign see dem I see danger. So dem great but Selaisse I greater. Me think me wanna lick upon shots. Upon a bloodclot. And fill the block with bumbaraas cops. Cops mi dun talk you know you watch me walks in. While black woman is getting raped across New Yorks And. Before another brother's in chalks And. I imagine somebody said that's your son dead, see him? See us we do the crime we do the time. Y'all get away scott-free. So police mi gonna pop you before you pop me. Cause if you get me you got me you shot me. Know'll lot me carry shotty since moms slap me. Cause my room sloppy. The youngest nigga out the camp is me. But nobody pampered me. So you better don't ramp with me. Fi see me, me don't play plenty. Chicks me blazed many. Raised plenty fi dollars. Storm upon mi prada. Watch a bomb holla. Watch 'im run, hit the floor. Told I'm come, come no. Throw ya ganja pon de air. 'plah!'. So watch for sticks and stones, stumbling blocks in piles. Life is one big road, miles on top of miles. So blessed be the soul that always remains a child. When most people don't even smile. There's a natural mystic, blowing tru the air. So keep it realistic, and always be aware. The truth is crying out, and it's so loud and so clear. But most people won't even hear. Spiritual pollution in the atmosphere. And with so much confusion, can one be happy here. The gift of Rastafari is for all man to share. But some would rather to be so unfair.",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1

Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again. Go on, take on this whole world. But to me you know you'll always be, my little girl. When you were in trouble that crooked little smile could melt my heart of stone. Now look at you, I've turned around and you've almost grown. Sometimes you're asleep I whisper ""I Love You!"" in the moonlight at your door. As I walk away, I hear you say, ""Daddy Love You More!"". Someday, some boy will come and ask me for your hand. But I won't say ""yes"" to him unless I know, he's the half. That makes you whole, he has a poet's soul, and the heart of a man's man. I know he'll say that he's in love.

Put the black crepe and the coolin' board away. Take the bunting down I ain't leaving town today. The choice is yours and so is the consequence. You don't win no medal for sitting on the fence. Sometime the warmest smile comes from the saddest face. Sometimes the brightest light comes from the darkest place. Don't talk of ghosts while the sun still shines. There's gold aplenty waiting in the mines. I have no fear of death but I am scared of dying. And the heaven they are selling I just ain't buying. Sometimes the truest kiss comes with a whore's embrace. Sleep is for dreamers and dreaming is for fools. If you've got guilt to carry then know carrying's for mules. It's the fate of man to live not as God. Whoever wrote the book was such a silly sod. Sometimes the fastest thrill comes from the longest chase. Death never takes the wise man by surprise. But who here among us can call themselves wise. God whispers in my ear that my halo is aflame. It's too easy to look for someone else to blame. Sometimes the weakest man fights with the strongest faith. Sometimes the biggest prizes comes from the shortest race. Sometimes the slightest sigh fills up the biggest space.,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

Hurt me in my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap. How he go out like that? Rumors in the hood was Just was snitching. I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSXR. Had the 4-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3. Used to drive his truck through the hood dragging jet skis. From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised. Of how freely I throw out names of guys who dealt with pies. Like LA and Wise, L got shot in the neck, then told his connect. Them niggas who shot them got 'em for ten bricks. Fucking Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks. That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on. Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Qu'ran. I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe. And Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose. Throughout my struggles in the hood, I started learning. Life's a bitch with a pretty face, but she burning. Man I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar. Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tah-Tah. Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facing. Go against crews like Bebo and killers like Pappy Mason. A lot of niggas I know been corrupted since birth. Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth. I know some cats that held down whole complexes like Corley Wall. Together niggas stand and divided they fall. Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion. Come around here with your Rollie, you can get robbed like Ocean. Lord knows, Tommy had Laurelton sold. Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior. Might sound like I'm fantasizing, but son I'm dead serious. Montana was no dummy, brought business to wash the money. Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian. Feds couldn't catch him dirty, so settled for tax evasion. Rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about, yo. The twins was from Queens but got crazy cream with Alpo. Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy. Jamaican Pauly, Duckie Corley. Ronnie Bumps and Chick... shit. A lot a niggas flow the way I flow. But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know. Writing rhymes is the best way I express how I feel. If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail. Coming up I heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused. And if you watch the news you see players in this game that lose. I'm forgetting Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance. Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags. In a conversation over shrimp and lobster. At Benihana's, heard Chico stopped boxing, and started robbing diners. Shout out to Clarence and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will. If the flow don't kill you the MAC will.",0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1

She holds me back. But she goes too far. Winding me up just to let me down. So emotional. Gagged and bound. There's more to this than meets the eye. A devil woman locked inside. With the formal rising. I was scared. I think I was possesed. Everytime your body's next to mine. Somethin' deep inside of me. Wants to love you endlessly. Girl, you don't know. How it makes me feel. I just can't believe it's real. I can't believe it's real!. She had an attitude. I can't explain. You never know if your in flame. Tying me up with elastic words. I'm on a countdown till I get hurt.

2Pac,Hip-Hop,Dear Mama,Me Against the World,1995.0,"Dear Mama. You are appreciated. When I was young, me and my mama had beef. Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets. Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face. Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place. Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool. With the big boys breakin' all the rules. I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years. We was poorer than the other little kids. And even though we had different daddies, the same drama. When things went wrong we'd blame Mama. I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell. Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell. And who'd think in elementary, hey. I'd see the penitentiary one day? And runnin' from the police, that's right. Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside. And even as a crack fiend, Mama. You always was a black queen, Mama. I finally understand. For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man. You always was committed. A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it. There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan. Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated. Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama). Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated). Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair. No love from my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there. He passed away and I didn't cry, 'cause my anger. Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger. They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along. I was lookin' for a father, he was gone. I hung around with the thugs. And even though they sold drugs. They showed a young brother love. I moved out and started really hangin'. I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'. I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks. It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox. I love payin' rent when the rent is due. I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you. 'Cause when I was low you was there for me. And never left me alone, because you cared for me. And I could see you comin' home after work late. You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate. You just workin' with the scraps you was given. And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'. But now the road got rough, you're alone. You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own. And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan. Pour out some liquor and I reminisce. 'Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama. And when it seems that I'm hopeless. You say the words that can get me back in focus. When I was sick as a little kid. To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did. And all my childhood memories. Are full of all the sweet things you did for me. And even though I act crazy. I gotta thank the Lord that you made me. There are no words that can express how I feel. You never kept a secret, always stayed real. And I appreciate how you raised me. And all the extra love that you gave me. I wish I could take the pain away. If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day. Everything will be alright if you hold on. It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on. Sweet lady, lady (Dear Mama). Lady, lady.",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

De La Soul,Hip-Hop,Drawn,and the Anonymous Nobody,2016.0,"Drawn. Shadow you're drawn, why don't you go? In the corner babe watching the snow. Moving afar, rolling away. In the corner, believe, why won't you stay? Won't you stay babe? Oh, I never know what come around. I never looked ahead. I'm wreckin' rules and it's pulling us down. The words I wished I'd said. Shadow you're drawn and you got your ways. Shadow you're painted red, red. It's drawn, it's drawn. One, two. Yo, I'm what the paper plate couldn't hold. Too many dreams, a paperweight took a toll. Food on the floor, not to be wasted. Or doing what's being pasted and know that it's not a copy. Eye on the prize, instead of gas prices. Lyrically wonder why I travel past the nicest. Born of a generation that don't generate patience. And travel too fast for you to clock me. Not always a good thing. You can lose the love of your life to a lifetime of love on tour. I didn't mean to be a whore but my hormones. Had me like a fiend screamin' ""What you got for me?"". Two words (I'm mortal). But the fans slid 'em both together and removed the apostrophe. ""Hip hop lords""? Maybe, but my ways needs laundering. Time's a-ticking, stop squandering!.",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1
